## Sites

The occurrence of broad climatic variation in a relatively small geographic area and a relatively simple geology and flora [@Carlquist1980; @Wagner1990; @Vitousek1995] make Hawai'i a good location to test hypotheses about carbon/nutrient interactions with changing water availability.
We identified a natural precipitation gradient consisting of five sites ranging from 500 mm to 5500 mm mean annual precipitation.

The five study sites were located near 700 m elevation on the island of Hawai'i (Fig. 1).
The dominant wind pattern is the northeast trade wind, which brings year-round precipitation to most of the northeast part of the island [@Giambelluca1986].
However, the masses of Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea Volcanoes (elevation 4169 m and 4205 m respectively) prevent precipitation from reaching the west and northwest sides of the island, resulting in much drier conditions on the leeward slopes [@Carlquist1980].
These parts of the island receive precipitation through the action of daytime, sea-to-land breezes resulting from the differential heating of land and ocean, which are maximum during the summer months [@Price1983].
As a result, Hawai'i supports a wide gradient of precipitation at a single elevation in a small area.

Three of the sites were on lava flows from Mauna Loa Volcano, while two sites were located on Hualalai Volcano.
The geology of both Hualalai and Mauna Loa have been well mapped, and the age of many of the flows is known with precision.
The substrate age at each of the sites was between 2300 and 2800 years [@Lockwood1988; @Moore1991].
We conducted sampling in areas with relatively gentle slopes at all sites to minimize possible complications from run-on and upslope effects.
Community composition varied from an open-canopied, savanna-type forest, dominated by *Metrosideros polymorpha* Gaud. (Myrtaceae) and *Diospyros sandwicensis* (A. DC.) Fosb (Ebenaceae) at the driest extreme to a close-canopied multistoried forest dominated by *M. polymorpha* and *Acacia koa* Gray (Fabaceae) at the wettest site [@Wagner1990].
Many of the plant species were present in two or more sites, while other species were restricted to a single site.
*M. polymorpha* was present at all sites and was the dominant species at four of the five sites.
Only a pubescent variety (var. *incana*) of *M. polymorpha* was found at the drier sites and only a glabrous variety (var. *glaberrima*) was found at the wetter sites [@Stemmerman1983].
General site characteristics are described in Table 1.

## Soil analysis

Surface soil samples were taken at each site in a stratified design in June 1995.
In general, the nature of 'a'a lava flows does not allow for the development of a true soil profile.
Organic matter and weathered parent material collect in the interstices of the rocks, and the result is a patchy distribution of fine material among the original 'a'a rocks.
Whenever possible, we sampled the top 10 cm of soil, but at the two driest sites (Kaniku and Kaupulehu), we collected soil in crevices of the 'a'a flows.
At all sites, we located five 50-m transects, spaced 20 m apart.
Samples were taken at 10-m intervals along each transect, and then all samples from the transect were composited and treated as a sample.
Within 48 h, we determined soil moisture for each composite sample by drying a subsample in a 105°C oven for 48 h, and we extracted a 10-g soil sample (5 g for the Kaniku site) in 75 ml (50 ml for the Kaniku site) 2 M KCl to determine concentrations of inorganic ammonium and nitrate.
A second sample from each transect was incubated at ambient soil moisture for 14 days and then extracted in 2 M KCl for determination of net mineralization.
A subsample of each composite was analyzed in a soil slurry of 1:1 with distilled water for pH; another subsample was acid-digested for total nitrogen and phosphorus using a standard Kjehdahl acid-digestion procedure.
Concentrations of magnesium, potassium, and calcium were determined by extraction of 10 g of soil in 50 ml of 2 M NaCl and analysis of extracts with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
We determined inorganic phosphate concentrations in soils by extraction in water with anion-exchange-resin bags and subsequent extraction of resin bags in 0.5 M HCl.
All extracts for nitrogen and phosphorus were analyzed colorimetrically on an Alpkem autoanalyzer.

## Foliar analysis

We collected small branches of *M. polymorpha* and other overstory species in full sunlight in all of the sites and collected fully developed, mature leaves closest to the developing bud.
While leaf-age differences could be important [@Reich1992], we used this consistent method of collection in order to minimize possible developmental differences in leaf growth among the sites.
Leaves taken from each individual tree were placed in plastic bags on ice within hours of collection and were treated collectively as a single sample.
We measured leaf areas within 48 h of collection using a Delta-T leaf-area meter.
Samples were oven-dried at 70°C for at least 48 h and then weighed to determine leaf mass per area.
We ground the dried leaves in a 20-mesh Wiley mill, and subsamples were analyzed for foliar nitrogen and phosphorus using a standard Kjehldahl acid-digestion procedure.
Extracts were analyzed with an Alpkem autoanalyzer.
We combusted a second subsample in a 500°C muffle furnace, extracted the ash in nitric acid, and determined concentrations of magnesium, calcium, and potassium of the extracts using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
Finally, lignin concentrations in *M. polymorpha* were determined using a modified acetyl bromide procedure, with extracts analyzed with a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer [@Morrison1972; @Iiyama1990].

## Isotopic analysis

Five samples of *M. polymorpha* from each site, a composite sample of each of the other native trees, and five composite soil samples from each site were ground to a fine powder in a ball mill grinder and sent for analysis to the University of Utah Stable Isotope Facility for Environmental Research in Salt Lake City.
Foliar samples were analyzed for $\delta^{13}$C and $\delta^{15}$N (expressed in parts per mil,‰), while soils were analyzed for $\delta^{15}$N only, following methods described in @Evans1993 and @Ehleringer1988.
Values are expressed relative to the PDB standard for $\delta^{13}$C and relative to atmospheric nitrogen for $\delta^{15}$N, according to the following equation:
$$ \delta Z = [(R_{sample})/(R_{standard}) - 1] \times 1000 $$
where *Z* = the heavy isotope of either nitrogen or carbon, and *R* = ratio of heavier to lighter isotope for the sample and standard ($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C or $^{15}$N/$^{14}$N).

Statistical analysis for soils and *M. polymorpha* leaves involved a series of one-way ANOVA with mean annual precipitation as the treatment effect.
*Post hoc* mean comparisons were completed using the Tukey-Kramer honestly significant difference (HSD) test.
Soil values were log-transformed in order to correct for non-normality, while the analysis for *M. polymorpha* used untransformed data, with a significance level of 5% in all cases.
