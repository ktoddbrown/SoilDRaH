abstract = {Agroforestry can increase the sequestration of carbon (C) in soils of tropical agroecosystems through increased litter and tree pruning inputs. Decomposition of these inputs is a key process in the formation of soil organic matter and in nutrient cycling. Our objectives were to study decay of tree pruning mulch and effects on soil C and N in a shaded coffee agroecosystem in Hawaii. Chipped tree pruning residues (mulch) were added to coffee plots shaded with the Leucaena hybrid KX2 over three years. We measured mulch decomposition and nitrogen loss over one year and changes in soil carbon and nitrogen (N) over two years. Mass loss of mulch was 80% over one year and followed first-order decay dynamics. There was significant loss from all major biochemical components. Net N loss from the mulch was positive throughout the entire period. The C:N and lignin:N ratios of the mulch declined significantly over the decomposition period. Mulch additions significantly increased soil C and N in the top 20 cm by 10.8 and 2.12 Mg ha−1, respectively. In the no-mulch treatment, there was no significant change in soil C or N concentration, but a decline in soil bulk density led to a significant decline in total soil C. Leucaena mulch can provide an important source of organic C and N to coffee agroecosystems and can help sequester C lost as plant biomass during shade tree management.},
