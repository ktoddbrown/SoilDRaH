Mapped nonforest conditions are also assigned numbers. At the time of the plot establishment, the condition class at plot center (the center of subplot 1) is usually designated as condition class 1. Other condition classes are assigned numbers sequentially at the time each condition class is delineated. On a plot, each sampled condition class must have a unique number that can change at remeasurement to reflect new conditions on the plot.

For example, in cases where the subplot has at least one forested condition class and the soil sampling site is not in a forested condition class, soil samples are not collected.
