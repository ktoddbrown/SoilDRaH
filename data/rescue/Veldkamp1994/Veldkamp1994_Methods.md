# MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Study Sites

The study was carried out in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica.
The climate is humid tropical; mean annual temperature is 26 °C and mean annual rainfall is about 4000 mm.
Precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration in all months.

The study area is situated on the foot slopes of the Turrialba volcano, and is covered with laharic, fluvio-laharic, and fluvial deposits, mostly of andesitic composition.
Tropical lowland rain forest is the natural vegetation.
[@Tosi1969] distinguished the life zones Premontane Wet Forest and Tropical Wet Forest in the area.
After deforestation, one of the dominant land use types is pasture.

An important assumption of the δ<sup>13</sup>C method is that the soils under pasture are directly comparable to those under forest.
For that reason, particular attention was paid to site selection.
A deforestation map was made and combined with an available soil map in a GIS [@Veldkamp1992].
Corresponding forest and pasture sites were selected within 1 km of each other.
On all sites, clearing was done by small farmers without heavy machinery.
Valuable tree trunks were removed along a few tracks and others were cut and left on the sites.
Generally, stumps were not removed.
If burning was done, it was restricted to piles.
The location of former burning piles was easily identified by the charcoal left in the soil.
Soil profiles were sampled only where there were no morphological indications of significant disturbance or burning during clearing.
Pasture grasses are normally planted directly after clearing, without any further land preparation treatment.

Three well-drained soil types were sampled: an Eutric Hapludand, an Oxic Humitropept, and an Andic Humitropept [@SoilSurveyStaff1990].
The studied soil profiles contained only negligible amounts on rock fragments.
In Table 1, some important soil characteristics are summarized.
Two sites of the Eutric Hapludand were selected: one under natural forest vegetation and the other site that had been manually cleared about 25 yr earlier and put under tropical carpetgrass pasture [*Axonopus compressus* (Sw.) P. Beauv.].
Two Oxic Humitropept sites were selected: one under forest vegetation, where some trees had been removed, and the other under 25-yr-old pasture (*A. compressus*).
On the Andic Humitropept, five sites were selected: one site in natural forest, four others in pastures dominated by *Isschaeum indicum* (Houtt.) Merr. of 3, 5, 10, and ≈18 yr.
On the younger pasture sites, decomposing tree trunks and stumps were still present.

## Sampling and Sample Processing

Soil bulk density was sampled at five depths (*n* ≥ 8, depending on variability) using 0.3 x 10<sup>-1</sup> m<sup>3</sup> stainless steel rings.
The samples were oven dried for 24 h at 105 °C.
Disturbed soil samples of about 1.5 kg were taken at 0.05-m intervals to 1.0 m.
Soil samples were homogenized, air dried, and sieved to pass 2 mm.
Litter and root material were separated manually from the soil.
Air-dry soil, litter, and root samples were stored for <sup>13</sup>C analysis.
Organic C and δ<sup>13</sup>C analyses were carried out in the Isotope Physics Laboratory of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands.
To measure the <sup>13</sup>C composition, soil samples were first ground and treated with 1 *M* HCl to remove any CaCO<sub>3</sub>.
The samples were then oven dried at 80 °C.
About 1 g of the samples was burned in the presence of CuO under pure O<sub>2</sub> at 900 °C.
Water vapor was trapped on dry ice.
The CO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> were trapped with help of liquid air (-186 °C).
Oxygen was evacuated and NO<sub>x</sub> was reduced to N<sub>2</sub> in the presence of Cu.
The remaining pure CO<sub>2</sub> was trapped with the help of liquid air and analyzed on a SIRA 9 mass spectrometer (VG Isogas Ltd., Cheshire, England).
The laboratory reference was calibrated against V-PDB, using the international standard NBS 19 (available from the National Bureau of Standards).
Analytical precision determined as the standard deviation obtained on different combustions of the same homogenized sample is better than 0.05‰ δ<sup>13</sup>C.

Soil pH was measured by glass electrode in supernatant above a 1:2.5 soil/water suspension.
Cation-exchange capacity was determined at pH 7 by NH<sub>4</sub>OAc.
Iron and Al were determined on the disturbed soil samples by atomic absorption spectrophotometry in pyrophosphate extracts and in acid oxalate extracts [@Mizota1989].
Clay mineralogy was determined by x-ray diffraction on the clay fraction.

## Calculations

Carbon contents of soil samples, C<sub>s</sub> (kg C kg<sup>-1</sup> soil), were converted to TOC (Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>), based on soil layer thickness, *L* (m), and bulk density, ρ<sub>b</sub> (Mg m<sup>-3</sup>):

TOC = C kg<sup>-1</sup> *L* ρ<sub>b</sub> × 10<sup>4</sup>     [1]

Forest clearing and cultivation may cause compaction.
On the Andic Humitropept, deforestation sequence bulk density gradually increased in time, which suggests that in this case not clearing practices but cattle trampling was the main reason for compaction [@Keller1993].
On all pasture sites bulk density may have an important effect on C-balance calculations, because samples in the forest at a certain depth are not directly comparable with samples in the pasture at the same depth.
For example, if the bulk density of the first layer increases from 0.6 Mg m<sup>-3</sup> in the forest to 0.8 Mg m<sup>-3</sup> in the pasture, the 0.1-m top layer in the forest corresponds to a 0.075-m layer in the pasture.
Thickness of layers in the pasture soils were adjusted assuming that the relationship between ρ<sub>b</sub> and depth in the pasture was originally the same as found in the corresponding forest profiles.

The amounts of SOC<sub>f</sub> and SOC<sub>p</sub> were estimated from the equation [@Vitorello1989]

TOC δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>p</sub> = (SOC<sub>f</sub> δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>f</sub>) + (SOC<sub>p</sub> δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>r</sub>)  [2]

where:
δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>p</sub> = δ<sup>13</sup>C value of sample from pasture soil, corrected for compaction;
δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>f</sub> = δ<sup>13</sup>C value of corresponding sample from forest soil
δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>r</sub> = δ<sup>13</sup>C value of pasture residues (litter and roots).
In Eq. [2], variations in δ<sup>13</sup>C due to mineralization after a change in land use are ignored.
