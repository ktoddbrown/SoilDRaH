	abstract     = {Abstract In this study we have tried to link a quantitative inventory of deforestation to possible factors driving forest clearing, like accessibility and soil quality. The Study Area covered 395 km2 in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica. Basic information came from aerial photographs taken in 1952, 1960, 1971 to 73, 1981 and 1984. Photo interpretations were digitized and processed with the help of a monoplotting programme. Three phases in deforestation were distinguished: 1 The period before 1960, characterized by a gradual increase in the rate of deforestation, with preferential clearing along rivers and on fertile soils. 2 The period 1960-1972. This period shows an increased clearing rate caused by a new centre of colonization, Cariari. Furthermore, banana plantations entered the area and main roads were constructed. Deforestation took place preferentially along roads and on fertile soils. 3 In the period 1972-1984 the remaining forest ‘islands’ were cleared at an accelerated rate. This was because only small areas of forest were left by this period. Also between 1972 and 1984 the fertile soils were cleared most rapidly.},

	abstract     = {Abstract Soil carbon (C) distribution, natural 13C abundances and their changes as a consequence of cropping were studied in three neighboring areas on an Oxisol from Brazil. One site (T0) was under forest, while the two other sites (T12 and T50) had been deforested, then cultivated with sugar cane for 12 and 50 yr, respectively. Soil morphological, chemical and mineralogical characteristics in all three sites were very similar. Total C content of the 0.06-m layer of T0 was twice that of T12 and T50, then decreased sharply with depth, to values similar to the other profiles. Delta 13C had practically constant values of −25.1, −22.8, and −20.4‰, throughout the 0 to 0.30-m layer of T0, T12, and T50 respectively. These values increased in deeper layers, to about −17‰, due to increased humification and possibly to deposition of organic matter from a former 13C-rich vegetation. The 0.10- to 0.20-m layer was separated into particle-size fractions and alkaline extract. Carbon contents decreased from T0 to T50 in the sand-size fractions and alkaline extracts, but did not change in the clay-size fractions. Delta 13C values were used to estimate the proportions of C derived from forest (Cdff) and from sugar cane (Cdfc). Carbon derived from sugar cane represented 17.3 ± 3.2 percent and 40.5 ± 2.2 percent of total C in T12 and T50, respectively. It reached its maximum value (67 ± 3.7 percent) in the coarse sand fraction of T12 and T50 and decreased with decreasing fraction size, to 13.8 ± 9.4 percent and 30.5 ± 6.5 percent in the fine clay fractions of T12 and T50, respectively. Thus, Cdff persisted mainly in the clay-size fraction.},
