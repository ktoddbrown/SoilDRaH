# Materials and methods

## *Study area*

The study was carried out in the Kaupulehu Dry Forest Preserve (608m elevation, 19°46′05″N, 155°56′19″W), located on the northwest slope of Hualalai Volcano in the district of North Kona, Island of Hawaii (see @Litton2006).
Based on aerial photography, *P. setaceum* has been a dominant component of this landscape since at least the early 1960s, and likely decades earlier.
Experimental plots were located in a 7-8m tall mature forest that is dominated by two native evergreen trees, *Diospyros sandwicensis* (A. DC) Fosb. and *Psydrax odorata* (Forst. F.) A. C. Sm. and S. Darwin, which together account for >91% of the total basal area and stem density [@Litton2006].

Parent material of the study site consists of tholeiitic basalt laid down primarily as ′a′a lava flows (rough and blocky) ~1500-3000 years ago [@Moore1987].
Soils are shallow, highly organic (fine fraction of mineral soil >30% C), >50% coarse rocks (>5mm) by volume, with an average pH of 7.6 (±0.1), and are classified as euic, isothermic, shallow, Lithic Ustifolist (USDA-NRCS classification).
The high soil C content and vegetation characteristics suggest that our study area occurs on the far upper end of the estimated substrate age range (see @Stemmermann1993), and may well be older.

Long-term mean annual rainfall for the study area is ~700-750mm, with great year-to-year variability [@Giambelluca1986; @Litton2006].
Mean annual rainfall from 1999 to 2005 was 514mm, with a low of 225mm in 1999 and a high of 1249mm in 2004.
Large rainfall events can occur during any month, but summers tend to be drier than winters.
Total annual precipitation was 732mm during Year 1 of this study (May 1, 2003 to April 30, 2004) and 1189mm during Year 2 (May 1, 2004 to April 30, 2005).
At a nearby weather station (~10km; 709m elevation; 19°47′42″N, 155°50′43″W), mean daily temperature for 2004-2005 was 20.0°C, with a mean daily maximum of 25.6°C and a mean daily minimum of 15.1°C.

## *Experimental design*

Work was conducted in a series of eight forested plots (12m × 12m) that were randomly established in July 2000 - the grass understory was removed from half of the plots (removal plots) and left intact in the remaining four plots (grass plots).
Tree basal area and stem density did not differ between treatments (*P*>0.78; Table 1).
In June 2003, an additional 4m buffer was established around plots to minimize edge effects (20m × 20m plots with all measurements taken in the central 12m × 12m).
Grass was removed from removal plots and buffer areas with a general herbicide and manual extraction of aboveground biomass [@Cordell2002].
Grass seedlings were pulled from removal plots on a regular basis.
At the start of the study, 3 years after plot establishment, the understory in grass plots was a monospecific cover of *P. setaceum*, while the understory in removal plots consisted of scattered native shrub, vine and graminoid species which established following grass removal [*Lipochaeta subcordata* A. Gray; *Cocculus trilobus* (Thunb.) DC; *Sicyos lasiocephalus* Skottsb.; and *Mariscus hillebrandii* (Boeck.) T. Koyama].

## *Soil C pools*

C pools were quantified in litter, roots, mineral soil, and microbial biomass in three plots per treatment in July 2003 (Year 1), and again in March 2005 (Year 2; minus roots).
Litter layer C (i.e. forest floor) was estimated by collecting all surface litter down to the mineral soil interface within three randomly placed 0.0625m<sup>2</sup> frames plot<sup>-1</sup>.
Litter samples were dried to a constant weight in a forced air oven, ground in a Wiley Mill to pass a 0.5mm<sup>2</sup> mesh (size 40), and analyzed for C content on a Fisons NA-1500 elemental analyzer (Fison Instruments, Milan, Italy).

For root (fine and coarse) and mineral soil C, two randomly located soil pits in three plots of each treatment were excavated under the 0.0625m<sup>2</sup> litter layer quadrants by digging down to consolidated, dense basalt at depths ranging from 15 to 30cm.
The content of each pit passing through a 2mm sieve was classified as the mineral soil fine fraction (<2mm).
All remaining material was separated into fine (<2mm) and coarse (≥2mm) roots, mineral soil coarse fraction (≥2 and <5mm), and rocks (≥5mm).
Fine roots correspond to total fine root biomass (live + dead).
Fine and coarse roots were dried, ground and analyzed for C content as above.
Our estimates of root C are underestimates because they do not account for C in tree root crowns or deep roots in cracks extending below the consolidated basalt.
Well-mixed subsamples of the mineral soil fine fraction were dried in a forced air oven to a constant weight, ground for 24h on a roller mill, and analyzed for C content as above.
Organic matter in the mineral soil coarse fraction and rocks (fine roots and soil organic matter in the porous rocks) was estimated by processing subsamples in a muffle furnace at 400°C for 12h [@Nelson1996]; percent C of combusted material was estimated as 33.6% (mean of all mineral soil fine fraction samples).
Soil bulk density of each fraction, needed to scale concentrations to mass per unit area, was determined by backfilling each pit with fine cinder to determine total pit volume and quantifying the volume of the pit occupied by each fraction.

Microbial biomass C (C<sub>mic</sub>) was quantified on well-mixed samples of the mineral soil fine fraction at both sampling dates using the chloroform fumigation extraction method modified from @Vance1987.
We used an identical procedure to that described in @Litton2003, except that air-dried samples were rewetted to 50% water-holding capacity and incubated for 7-10 days before extraction, all extracts were diluted 5× before C content analysis, and a $k_{EC}$ of 0.45 was used due to high organic matter content in our soils [@Sparling1990].

## *Soil-surface CO$_2$ efflux*

Soil-surface CO<sub>2</sub> efflux (*R*$_{soil}$) was measured monthly at eight points in each plot with a LI-COR 6400 portable photosynthesis system and LI-COR 6400-09 soil respiration chamber (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA).
We used permanently placed 10cm diameter polyvinyl chloride (PVC) collars inserted 4cm into the litter and mineral soil.
Two measurements were made at each point by drawing down chamber CO<sub>2</sub> concentration below ambient concentrations at the soil surface, and measuring chamber CO<sub>2</sub> concentration from 10ppm below ambient to 10ppm above ambient.

We quantified the temperature sensitivity and diel course of *R*$_{soil}$ by measuring efflux on all eight collars in one plot of each treatment every 3h for 24h in July 2004.
In addition, we quantified the effects of discrete pulse precipitation events on *R*$_{soil}$ by measuring efflux 2 days before a large pulse event (95mm), 1 day after the pulse event, and every 2-3 days thereafter for a month on all eight collars in one plot of each treatment.

To explore the relationship between *R*$_{soil}$ and environmental variables, we quantified soil water potential ($\Psi_{soil}$) and soil temperature throughout the experiment in three plots of each treatment.
$\Psi_{soil}$ at 10cm was measured weekly at four locations per plot using individually calibrated *in situ* thermocouple psychrometers (PST-55) and a microvolt meter (HR-33 T) operating in dew point depression mode (Wescor, Logan, UT, USA).
Continuous, hourly measurements of soil temperature at 10cm were made on three locations per plot with high-resolution temperature sensors (TMC6-HD; Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA).

Annual cumulative *R*$_{soil}$ (g C m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) was estimated using two approaches that rely on linear interpolation to fill in missing daily values.
In the ‘monthly interpolation’ approach we used linear interpolation between monthly *R*$_{soil}$ measurements, while in the ‘weekly interpolation’ approach we supplemented monthly *R*$_{soil}$ measurements with weekly *R*$_{soil}$ estimates based on the relationship between $\Psi_{soil}$ and *R*$_{soil}$ (see ‘Results’).
*R*$_{soil}$ exhibited no temperature or diel response (see ‘Results’), so measured instantaneous rates (μmol CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) were scaled to daily C flux rates (g C m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) with no temperature or diel correction.

## *Aboveground litterfall and litter decomposition*

Tree aboveground litterfall was collected monthly in all plots from eight 0.1764m<sup>2</sup> traps.
Litter from each trap was dried at 70°C to a constant mass in a forced air oven and weighed.
The C content of litterfall was analyzed as above on a subset of composite samples, and the mean value (43.7%) was used to quantify aboveground litterfall C flux.
For grass and all other understory vegetation, annual litterfall was assumed equivalent to annual aboveground net primary production, which was estimated by summing positive increments in live and dead standing biomass (trough-peak analysis) in grass plots (grasses), and with clip plots during peak standing biomass in removal plots (all other understory vegetation) [@Scurlock2002].
Grass biomass was 44.5% C.

Litter decomposition of *D. sandwicensis* and *P. setaceum* foliage was assessed *in situ* for 10 months with 100cm<sup>2</sup> litterbags made of 2mm fiberglass mesh.
Recently senesced foliage was collected in all plots, air dried and composited by species and treatment.
A well-mixed subsample of each species and treatment combination was dried to a constant mass in a forced air oven to determine percent moisture for correcting initial litter mass.
Approximately 1.5g of intact, air-dried litter was weighed and placed in each litterbag, and four litterbags of each species and treatment combination were placed in plots in March, 2004 (*D. sandwicensis* in removal and grass plots, and *P. setaceum* in grass plots).
Initial litter chemistry (% C, N, lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) was determined on a well-ground subsample of each litter type and treatment combination using sequential C fraction analysis [@Ryan1990].
Litterbags were collected after 10 months, soil was carefully removed from each sample, samples were dried to a constant mass, weighed, and species replicated within a given plot were composited, ground in a Wiley mill, and analyzed for percent ash in a muffle furnace and CHN content on a Costech ECS 4010 Elemental Combustion Analyzer (Costech Analytical Technologies Inc., Valencia, CA, USA).

## *C$_4$ contribution to soil C pools and fluxes*

The grass contribution (C<sub>4</sub> grass) to soil C pools in the research area (C<sub>3</sub> forest) was assessed using a standard two-member isotope mixing model of the form

$f_{A} = \dfrac{\bar \delta_{M} - \bar \delta_{B}}{\bar \delta_{A} - \bar \delta_{B}}$, (1)

where $\bar \delta_{M}$, $\bar \delta_{A}$, and $\bar \delta_{B}$ are the mean $\delta^{13}$C isotopic signatures of the mixture (M) and sources A and B, respectively, and $f_{A}$ is the proportion of A in M [@Phillips2001].
The model was run separately for the litter layer, roots and mineral soil fine fraction.
End members (A and B) for each mixing model came from measured $\delta^{13}$C values of: (i) litter layer C - *P. setaceum* and tree litter; (ii) root C - *P. setaceum* and tree roots; and (iii) mineral soil C - *P. setaceum* roots and preinvasion soil organic matter (no C<sub>4</sub> contribution) calculated as the $\delta^{13}$C signature of tree foliage enriched by 2‰.
The 2‰ enrichment assumption for mineral soil end member designation is based on: (i) a nearby (<5km), uninvaded dry forest with similar vegetation (see @Litton2006), where the isotopic signature of bulk mineral soil is 2.04‰ enriched compared with *in situ* tree foliage (C. M. Litton, unpublished data); and (ii) the commonly observed phenomenon in forest ecosystems that mineral soil is enriched 1-3‰ compared with foliage [@Ehleringer2000].

We also quantified the grass (C<sub>4</sub>) contribution to *R*$_{soil}$ using a Keeling plot approach [@Pataki2003] on two locations in one plot of each treatment in July of 2004.
A custom soil chamber (0.02m<sup>3</sup>) was placed over the soil surface and sealed with an O-ring made from nylon hose filled with fine sand.
Soil chamber CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were determined by circulating air through the chamber with a LI-COR 6400 portable photosynthesis system.
Small samples of soil chamber air were extracted periodically via an inline septum using a 10mL syringe over 5-10min as chamber CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increased from ambient to ~550ppm.
Samples were stored in 10mL Exetainer vials (Labco, UK) that had been flushed and filled with He.
All samples were analyzed for $\delta^{13}$C within 60h of field sampling on a Finnigan MAT Delta-S isotope ratio mass spectrometer with precon at the Stable Isotope Ratio Facility for Environmental Research (University of Utah).
The *y*-intercept of the resulting least squared linear regression between $\delta^{13}$C (*y*-axis) and the inverse of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (1/[CO<sub>2</sub>]; *x*-axis), the Keeling plot [@Keeling1958], predicts the $\delta^{13}$C value of CO<sub>2</sub> entering the chamber from the soil.
A two-member mixing model was used to determine the C<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> contributions to *R*$_{soil}$ [@Phillips2001].
End members in the mixing model were measured $\delta^{13}$C values: grass roots for the C<sub>4</sub> component and grass-free forest mineral soil and tree roots for the C<sub>3</sub> component.
For the latter end member, we assumed that 50% of *R*$_{soil}$ was autotrophic (root, root exudates, mycorrhizae) and 50% heterotrophic (mineral soil) origin (see @Bond-Lamberty2004), such that the C<sub>3</sub> end member was calculated as the average of root and mineral soil $\delta^{13}$C.

Contribution to aboveground litterfall by trees (C<sub>3</sub>) and grasses (C<sub>4</sub>) was quantified by simply dividing litterfall flux of grasses or trees by total aboveground litterfall (tree + grass).

## *Leaf area index*

LAI (m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>-2</sup>) was estimated in August of both years for the overstory and understory between 4:00 and 6:00 hours on days with widespread cloud cover.
Overstory LAI was estimated with a pair of LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzers (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA), where diffuse solar radiation was measured below and above the canopy simultaneously.
Below canopy measurements were taken directly above the understory vegetation at 1.33m on eight points per plot on a systematic grid.
For understory LAI, we used the LAI-2000 operating in 1 unit mode, by taking measurements at the soil surface and at 1.33m.
We corrected understory LAI estimated to include only live foliage (LAI multiplied by %biomass in live tissues) by harvesting standing grass biomass from fifteen 0.25m<sup>2</sup> plots and quantifying the live:dead biomass ratio, with the assumption that live and dead foliage had similar mass per area, as well as reflective and transmittance properties.
Field data were analyzed using $_{FV}$ 2000 software masking the outermost ring (Li-Cor Inc.).
No corrections were made to account for woody biomass in the canopy and, therefore, our overstory LAI values refer to plant area, and likely overestimate leaf area [@Kalacska2005].

## *Statistical analysis*

The sample unit for this study was the plot and all data presented are mean plot values (*n*=3 or *n*=4 depending on the measurement).
All statistical analyses were performed in $_{SPSS}$ 10.0 for $_{WINDOWS}$ (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) at an $\alpha=0.05$.
All data were tested for assumptions of normality and equality of variance.
Tests for differences among treatments in stand structural characteristics, soil C pools, and the C<sub>4</sub> contribution to soil C pools and fluxes were performed using one-way analysis of variance ($_{ANOVA}$) - except for the C<sub>4</sub> contribution to *R*$_{soil}$, where treatment differences were analyzed with an independent sample *t*-test.
Treatment and time effects for *R*$_{soil}$ (instantaneous, daily and yearly), $F_{A}$ (monthly and yearly), soil temperature, and $\Psi_{soil}$ were analyzed with a repeated measures general linear model.
Linear and nonlinear regression techniques were used to explore the relationships between *R*$_{soil}$ and soil temperature, soil water potential, and LAI.
