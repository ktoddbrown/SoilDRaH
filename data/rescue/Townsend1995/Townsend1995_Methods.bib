@article{Raich1990,
	abstract = {Abstract The similarity of two commonly used methods of measuring CO2 fluxes from forest soils was assessed by directly comparing the sodalime method with a static chamber technique using gas chromatographic analysis of CO2 -concentration changes during short-term incubations. A paired-chamber sampling design was applied in 11 different forest stands to examine the two methods across a range of soil-CO2 efflux rates. Carbon dioxide efflux rates were highly variable within sites, and showed no spatial autocorrelation. No consistent differences in measured rates of CO2 efflux were observed between the two methods, indicating that either method may be applied to the range of mean daily rates encountered in this study (1.7--11.4 g mb2 db1). A large number of chambers can be deployed with the soda-lime method, but no information on diel variations in efflux rates is obtained. The short-term incubation technique, on the other hand, can be utilized to simultaneously monitor several trace gases and diel trends in flux rates. Selection between the methods should be based on the hypotheses being tested or on practical constraints.},

	abstract = {Century is a model of terrestrial biogeochemistry based on relationships between climate, human management (fire, grazing), soil properties, plant productivity, and decomposition. The grassland version of the Century model was tested using observed data from 11 temperate and tropical grasslands around the world. The results show that soil C and N levels can be simulated to within $\pm$25\% of the observed values (100 and 75\% of the time, respectively) for a diverse set of soils. Peak live biomass and plant production can be simulated within $\pm$ 25\% of the observed values (57 and 60\% of the time, respectively) for burned, fertilized, and irrigated grassland sites where precipitation ranged from 22 to over 150 cm. Live biomass can be generally predicted to within $\pm$50\% of the observed values (57\% of the time). The model underestimated the live biomass in extremely high plant production years at two of the Russian sites. A comparison of Century model results with statistical models showed that the Century model had slightly higher r2 values than the statistical models. Data and calibrated model results from this study are useful for analysis and description of grassland carbon dynamics, and as a reference point for testing more physiologically based models prediction's of net primary production and biomass. Results indicate that prediction of plant and soil organic matter (C and N) dynamics requires knowledge of climate, soil texture, and N inputs.},

@article{Parton1988,
	abstract = {We have developed a model to simulate the dynamics of C, N, P, and S in cultivated and uncultivated grassland soils. The model uses a monthly time step and can simulate the dynamics of soil organic matter over long time periods (100 to 10,000 years). It was used to simulate the impact of cultivation (100 years) on soil organic matter dynamics, nutrient mineralization, and plant production and to simulate soil formation during a 10,000 year run. The model was validated by comparing the simulated impact of cultivation on soil organic matter C, N, P, and S dynamics with observed data from sites in the northern Great Plains. The model correctly predicted that N and P are the primary limiting nutrients for plant production and simulated the response of the system to inorganic N, P, and S fertilizer. Simulation results indicate that controlling the C:P and C:S ratios of soil organic matter fractions as functions of the labile P and S levels respectively, allows the model to correctly simulate the observed changes in C:P and C:S ratios in the soil and to simulate the impact of varying the labile P and S levels on soil P and S net mineralization rates.},

@article{Parton1987,
	abstract = {Abstract We analyzed climatic and textural controls of soil organic C and N for soils of the U.S. Great Plains. We used a model of soil organic matter (SOM) quantity and composition to simulate steady-state organic matter levels for 24 grassland locations in the Great Plains. The model was able to simulate the effects of climatic gradients on SOM and productivity. Soil texture was also a major control over organic matter dynamics. The model adequately predicted aboveground plant production and soil C and N levels across soil textures (sandy, medium, and fine); however, the model tended to overestimate soil C and N levels for fine textured soil by 10 to 15\%. The impact of grazing on the system was simulated and showed that steady-state soil C and N levels were sensitive to the grazing intensity, with soil C and N levels decreasing with increased grazing rates. Regional trends in SOM can be predicted using four site-specific variables, temperature, moisture, soil texture, and plant lignin content. Nitrogen inputs must also be known. Grazing intensity during soil development is also a significant control over steady-state levels of SOM, and since few data are available on presettlement grazing, some uncertainty is inherent in the model predictions.},

@article{Cambardella1994,
	abstract = {The amount of organic matter present in soil and the rate of soil organic matter (SOM) turnover are influenced by agricultural management practices. Because SOM is composed of a series of fractions, management practices will also influence the distribution of organic C and N among SOM pools. Our study examined SOM fractions that are occluded within the aggregate structure. Aggregates were disrupted by sonication and the disrupted soil suspensions were passed through a series of sieves to isolate size fractions. Densiometric separations were carried out on the size fractions, creating size-density fractions. Fine-silt-size particles having a density of 2.07 to 2.22 g/cm3 isolated from inside macroaggregates contained the highest percentage of total soil C and N for all cultivation treatments and, because of its properties, will be referred to as the enriched labile fraction (ELF). As cultivation intensity was reduced, the amount of N in the ELF increased from 110 mg N/kg in the bare fallow treatment to 405 mg N/kg in the no-till treatment. About 5\% of the N in the ELF was mineralized during a 28-d laboratory incubation, averaged across treatments. The proportion of N mineralized from the ELF (4.7\%) was significantly higher than from intact macroaggregates (2.1\%), which suggests this fraction may be protected from decomposition within the aggregate structure. We postulate that the ELF is a byproduct of microbial activity and that it contributes to binding microaggregates into macroaggregates in cultivated grassland soils.},

@article{Trumbore1993,
	abstract = {The magnitude and timing of the response of the soil carbon reservoir to changes in land use or climate is a large source of uncertainty in global carbon cycle models. One method of assessing soil carbon dynamics, based on modeling the observed increase of 14C in organic matter pools during the 30 years since atmospheric weapons testing ended, is described in this paper. Differences in the inventory and residence time of carbon are observed in organic matter from soils representing tropical (Amazon Basin, Brazil) and temperate (western slope of the Sierra Nevada mountains, California) forest ecosystems. The majority of the organic carbon in the upper 22 cm of the tropical soil (7.1 kgC mb2) has residence times of 10 years or less, with a minor component of very refractory carbon. The estimated annual flux of carbon into and out of the soil organic matter in this horizon of the mineral soil, based on modeling of the 14C data, is between 1.9 and 5.5 kgC mb2 yrb1. In contrast, organic matter in the temperate soil over a similar depth interval (0-23 cm; 5.2 kgC mb2), is made up of approximately equal amounts of carbon with residence times of 10, 100, and 1000 years. The estimated annual flux of carbon into and out of this soil is 0.22 to 0.45 kgC mb2 yrb1. Rapid turnover of organic matter with density <1.6 - 2.0 g cmb3contributes a major component of the annual flux of carbon into and out of both soil types. Hydrolysis of mineral soil organic matter of density < 1.6-2.0 g cmb3 removed 14C-enriched components from the temperate soil but had no effect on the 14C content of the residue in 0 - 22 cm layer of the tropical soil. The results presented here show that carbon cycle models which treat soil carbon dynamics as a single reservoir with a turnover rate based on radiocarbon measurements of bulk soil organic matter underestimate the annual fluxes of organic matter through the soil organic matter pool, particularly in tropical regions.},
