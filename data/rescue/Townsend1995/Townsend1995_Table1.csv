"TABLE 1. Soil carbon pools and fluxes, carbon isotopes, pasture ages, and the percent forest-derived soil carbon calculated from <sup>13</sup>C data using Eq. 3. Sites are three C<sub>4</sub> pastures and two C<sub>3</sub> forests on the northeast flank of Mauna Kea Volcano, island of Hawaii. Values in parentheses are standard errors, and *N* = 15 for all but soil respiration (*N* = 75) and soil <sup>14</sup>C",,,,,,,,,,
