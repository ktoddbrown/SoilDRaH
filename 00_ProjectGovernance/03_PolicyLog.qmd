This document is a policy log where we manage the review process and document any changes.
We define a 'policy' as a decision that is applicable multiple situations.
A policy is intended to reduce cognitive load by making a standard practice that reduces the need for groups of people to make similar decisions. 
In most cases policies will be in the policy folder except for a few key, high level documents (like this one) that are in the primary governance folder. 
In all cases a link will the provided to the document.

A policy log can be thought of as similar to https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record and is based off of Sociocracy principles.

# Mission and vision - 2026 May

*Context:* We need a clear way to decern what is in scope and out of scope on the project, as well as a clear ask when inviting future collaboration. 
The mission should help us define that scope and vision should tell us what the world might look like when we get there. 
These will be aspirational and may not have clear metrics of success.

*Policy:* [01_MissionVision.qmd](01_MissionVission.qmd)

*Responsible:* @ktoddbrown

*Metric:* After presenting this to students involved with the project, new students starting on the project, and collaborators who are thinking about joining, are there common questions that surface that need to be addressed? Is this clear enough? Is it tightly scoped?

*Term:* 6 months - review May 2026

*Change log:*
  + 20251124 - initial draft committed
