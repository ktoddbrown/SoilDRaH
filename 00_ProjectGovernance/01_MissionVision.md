# SoilDRaH: Mission and vision


The **mission** of SoilDRaH project is to develop and maintain both semantic resources and community capacity to rescue, harmonization and reanalyze soil data from the primary research literature and other sources.

We see a **vision** of a world where:

- data stewardship is an active and valued component of soil science
- researchers at all levels are able to place their observations within the broader context of scientific data collected across decades and globally
- data usability and reanalysis is a community activity that lives on beyond a grant lifecycle or individual researcher’s career
- researchers support one another’s career in ways that are synergistic

See the Appendix of Todd-Brown et al. (2022) for narrative description of vision.

*A mission is the organizational focus for the immediate future.
A vision is how the world will be different once an organization achieves it’s mission.*
