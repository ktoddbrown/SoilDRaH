"Table 1. Climate and age characteristics for sites sampled along precipitation gradient in Hawai'i. Mean annual precipitation values were determined from @Giambelluca1986. Flow ages, elevation and origin were determined from maps for Mauna Loa [@Lockwood1988] and Hualalai [@Moore1991] and personal communication with J. Lockwood. Dominant vegetation type from @Wagner1990",,,,,,
