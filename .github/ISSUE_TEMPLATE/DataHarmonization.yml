      placeholder: "Data use: Use of data assumes that the user has joined the ISCN and will act according to the mission and guidelines stated in the Charter. Phase II data are available to select users on the condition that contributors will be invited to assist with interpretation, presentations, and publications, if these tasks are being performed by a user other than the original contributor of the data (such as a colleague of the contributor). When using Phase III data, users are encouraged to contact original data contributors for questions or clarifications; users agree to cite and/or acknowledge the data contributors and the ISCN in presentations and publications. References of all accepted papers developed from ISCN data products must be sent to the ISCN Coordinator. Although these policies are intended to encourage communication between data contributors and data users, the interpretation of data and adherence to fair use guidelines are ultimately the responsibility of the user of ISCN products."
