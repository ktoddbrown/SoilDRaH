	abstract = {The primary‐successional sere of a Hawaiian montane rain forest was inferred from an age sequence of eight closely located ‘a’ ā flows (clinker type lava); 8, 50, 140, ca. 300, ca. 400, ca. 1400, ca. 3000 and ca. 9000 yr, on a windward slope of Mauna Loa, Hawaii.
  All study sites (0.2 ha each) were at 1120 — 1250 m a.s.l. with 4000 mm mean annual rainfall.
  The 400‐yr, 1400‐yr, and 9000‐yr flows had younger volcanic ash deposits, while the others were pure lava.
  Comparisons of tree size and foliar nutrients suggested that ash increased the availability of nitrogen, and subsequently standing biomass.
  An Unweighted Pair Group Cluster Analysis on the samples (flows) using quantitative vascular species composition revealed that clusters were correlated with age regardless of the substrate types (pure lava vs. ash), and an indirect ordination on the samples suggested that the sequence of sample scores along axis 1 was perfectly correlated with the age sequence.
  Although ash deposits increased biomass, they did not affect the sequence of the successional sere.
  Both pubescent and glabrous varieties of Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae) dominated upper canopy layers on all flows ≥ 50 yr and ≤ 1400 yr, but the pubescent variety was replaced by the glabrous on the flows ≥ 3000 yr.
  Lower layers were dominated initially by a matted fern, Dicranopteris linearis, up to 300 yr, and subsequently by tree ferns, Cibotium spp., to 9000 yr.
  The cover of Cibotium declined slightly after 3000 yr, while other native herb and shrub species increased.
  A ‘climax’ stage in the conventional sense was apparently not reached on the observed age gradient, because the sere changed continuously in biomass and species; this divergent successional phenomenon may be unique to Hawaii where the flora is naturally impoverished and disharmonic due to its geographic isolation in contrast to more diverse and harmonic floras in continents.},

            Litter quality parameters such as nitrogen and lignin content correlate with decomposition rates at coarse scales, but fine‐scale mechanisms driving litter decomposition have proven more difficult to generalize. One potentially important driver of decomposition is the activity of extracellular enzymes that catalyze the degradation of complex compounds present in litter. To address the importance of this mechanism, we collected 15 Hawaiian plant litter types and decomposed them in fertilized and control plots for up to two years. We measured litter nutrient content and carbon chemistry prior to decomposition, as well as extracellular enzyme activities, mass loss, and litter nutrient content over time. We found that water‐soluble carbon content, cellobiohydrolase activities, and polyphenol oxidase activities were significantly correlated with mass loss. Enzyme activities and decomposition rate constants both varied significantly by litter type, and fertilization increased mass loss rates in five litter types. Some litter types that decayed faster under fertilization also showed time‐dependent increases in carbon‐degrading enzyme activities, but others decayed faster independent of enzyme changes. These results suggest that extracellular enzyme activities partially determine litter decomposition rates, but high soluble carbon content may circumvent the requirement for enzyme‐catalyzed decomposition.},

	abstract = {We tested the Walker and Syers (1976) conceptual model of soil development and its ecological implications by analyzing changes in soil P, vegetation, and other ecosystem properties on a soil chronosequence with six sites ranging in age from 300 yr to 4.1 x 10^6 yr.
	Climate, dominant vegetation, slope, and parent material of all of the sites were similar.
	As fractions of total P, the various pools of soil phosphorus behaved very much as predicted by Walker and Syers.
	HCI—extractable P (presumably primary mineral phosphates) comprised 82\% of total P at the 300—yr—old site, and then decreased to 1\% at the 20,000—yr—old site.
	Organic phosphorus increased from the youngest site to a maximum at the 150 000 yr site, and then declined to the 4.1 x 10^6 yr site. Occluded (residual) P increased steadily with soil age. In contrast to the Walker and Syers model, we found the highest total P at the 150 000—yr—old site, rather than at the onset of soil development, and we found that the non—occluded, inorganic P fraction persisted through to the oldest chronosequence site. Total soil N and C increased substantially from early to middle soil development in parallel with organic P, and then declined through to the oldest site. Readily available soil P, NH4+, and NO3— were measured using anion and cation exchange resin bags. P availability increased and decreased unimodally across the chronosequence. NH4+ and NO3—
  pools increased through early soil development, but did not systematically decline late in soil development.
  In situ decomposition rates of Metrosideros polymorpha litter were highest at two intermediate—aged sites with soil fertility (20 000 yr and 150 000 yr), and lowest at the less—fertile beginning (300 yr) and endpoint (4.1 x 10^6 yr) of the chronosequence.
  M. polymorpha leaves collected from these same four sites, and decomposed in a common site, suggested that leaves from intermediate—aged sites were inherently more decomposable than those from the youngest and oldest sites.
  Both litter tissue quality and the soil environment appeared to influence rates of decomposition directly.
  The highest mean soil N2O emissions (809 mg°m—2°d—1) were measured at the 20 000—yr—old site, which also had the highest soil nitrogen fertility status. Plant communities at all six chronosequence sites were dominated primarily by M. Polymorpha, and to a lesser extent by several other genera of trees and shrubs.
  There were, however, differences in overall vegetation community composition among the sites.
  Using a detrended correspondence analysis (DECORANA), we found that a high proportion of species variance among the sites (eigenvalue = 0.71) can be explained by site age and thus soil developmental stage.
  Overall, long—term soil development across the chronosequence largely coincides with the conceptual model of Walker and Syers (1976).
  How P is distributed among different organic and inorganic fractions at a given stage of soil development provides a useful context of evaluating contemporary cycling of P and other nutrients, and for determining how changes in P availability might affect diverse ecosystem processes.},

            Soil organic matter (SOM) in allophanic soils is supposed to accumulate due to protection caused by binding to allophane, aluminium and iron. We investigated a catena of allophanic and non‐allophanic soils in Costa Rica to determine the effect of such binding mechanisms on SOM chemistry. These soils contain no contribution of black carbon. Molecular characterization of litter, extractable and dispersed organic matter was done by Curie‐point pyrolysis‐GC/MS. The molecular chemistry of the organic fractions indicates a strong decomposition of plant‐derived organic matter and a strong contribution of microbial sugars and N‐compounds to SOM. Both the decomposition of plant‐derived SOM – including that of relatively recalcitrant compounds – and the relative contribution of microbial SOM were greater in allophanic samples than in non‐allophanic ones. This suggests that chemical protection does not act on primary OM, although it may influence the accumulation of secondary OM in these soils. The effect of allophane on SOM contents in such perhumid soils is probably through incorporation of decomposition products and microbial SOM in very fine aggregates that – in a perhumid environment – remain saturated with water during much of the year. Greater concentrations of aliphatics are found in allophanic residues, but there is no evidence of any specific mineral‐organic binding. The results do not support the existing theory of chemical protection of plant‐derived components through binding to allophane, iron and aluminium.},
