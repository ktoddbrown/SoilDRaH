# Methods

## Field Sampling

We sampled a wet tropical forest on the island of Hawaii in the Kohala Mountains.
The site is at 1200 m asl within a cool wet rainforest (16 °C and 2500 mm MAP) [@Vitousek2004].
Two species of plants were chosen due to their widespread presence throughout the Hawaiian Islands [@Kitayama1995], and their large difference in organic chemistry [@RaabUnpublisheda], nutrient concentrations, and decomposition rates [@Allison2004a; @Amatangelo2008].
We sampled three field replicates of live leaves, root mats, and attached, recently senesced litter from *C. trigynum*, a native angiosperm tree and *D. linearis*, a thicket-forming nonpolypod fern.
In the case of *Cheirodendron*, the litter layer beneath the species contains some litter contributions from other forest species including the common Hawaiian tree *Metrosideros polymorpha*.
For *D. linearis*, the dense thicket structure means that most of the surface litter under this species is derived from the fern—and fern mats can be relatively long-lived (decades) and so have been contributing to SOM formation for an extended period of time.

For both species, we sampled the soils beneath three replicates of each plant from two genetic soil horizons 0–3, 3–10 cm (O- and A-horizons, respectively) which have high OM contents (Table 1).
These soils have been extensively characterized [@Crews1995; @Vitousek1997], but are briefly described here.
The soil is classified as a Hydric Hydrudand, dominated by a non-crystalline mineralogy including allophane, imogolite, and ferrihydrite [@Torn1997; @Torn2005].
Sodium-extractable Fe$^{3+}$ + Al$^{3+}$ comprised 1.5 and 2.9% of the O and A-horizon, respectively [@Torn2005].
Soil texture is difficult to determine in Andisols and may be approximated from 15-bar water content (2.5% × 15 bar water content) [@Torn2005].
For the O and A-horizon, water contents were 69.9 and 33.2%, respectively, resulting in a texture of 43% clay, 51% silt, and 6% sand for the A-horizon [@Torn2005].
Interaction of soil water with the high OM content of the O-horizon resulted in silt + clay estimates greater than 100% and should not to be used quantitatively [@Torn2005].
Soil pH for the A-horizon was 3.9 [@Mikutta2009].
Samples were frozen at 0 °C and transported to the laboratory within 48 h of collection, on ice, and subsequently freeze-dried in bulk.

## Soil Fractionation and C/N Measurements

Soils were sieved to 2 mm removing large rocks and roots and subsequently dry sieved to obtain four aggregate fractions: 850–590, 590–180, 180–53, and less than 53 μm.
Samples were placed on the top sieve of the series of stacked sieves and shaken at moderate speed on a standard sieve shaker for 20 min (Grandy, personal comm.).
To assure that samples were separated, individual fractions were shaken at 5-min intervals until the sample loss was less than 0.01 g per interval.
Soil fractions were finely ball-ground, and C and N were measured using an EA 1110 CNS combustion analyzer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, Massachusetts).

## Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry and Methylation

Py-GC/MS is a method of assessing the molecular chemistry of OM including lignins, polysaccharides, aromatics, lipids, and proteins.
Py-GC/MS uses thermal, non-oxidative fragmentation of large molecules into fragments that can be identified and traced (in some cases) back to particular plant or microbial sources [@Hempfling1990; @White2004].
Unlike NMR that observes functional groups, py-GC/MS enables the observation of a diverse range of chemical constituents in fragments large enough to identify probable source molecules (that is, lignins, aromatics, proteins, and so on).
Although the method is generally only semiquantitative without the use of internal or external standards, it provides a relatively comprehensive evaluation of SOM chemistry, although slightly underestimating polysaccharides and fatty acid methyl esters [@Gauthier2002; @Grandy2007; @StewartUnpublished].
Use of differing GC columns can improve detection of select compounds.
The addition of tetramethylammonium-hydroxide (TMAH) to the sample improves detection of acids [@Hatcher1995] and of lignin monomer derivatives of guaiacyl (G), syringyl (S)- and *p*-coumaryl-derived (P) aldehydes, carboxylic acids, and ketones, which may be lost in conventional py-GC/MS due to their polarity [@Saiz1994; @delRio1998].

Py-GC/MS and TMAH-py-GC/MS analyses were performed as described elsewhere [@StewartUnpublished].
In brief, approximately 5–10 mg of sample was weighed into a pyrofoil (Pyrofoil F590, Japan Analytical Company, Tokyo, Japan) with and without preapplied 5 μl tetramethylammoniumhydroxide.
The samples were incubated for 24 h before pyrolyzing to allow TMAH to absorb into the sample [@Klingberg2005], then pyrolyzed at 590 °C within a Curie-point pyrolyzer (Pyromat; Brechbuhler Scientific Analytical Solutions, Houston, Texas).
Pyrolysis products were transferred online to a gas chromatograph (ThermoQuest Trace GC; Thermo-Finnigan, San Jose, California) with an interface temperature of 250 °C with a split-injection (split ratio 50:1, He carrier gas flow-rate 1.0 ml min$^{-1}$).
Separation of pyrolysis products was done on a BPX-5 column (60 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm) using a temperature program of 40 °C for 5 min, 5 °C min$^{-1}$ to 270 °C followed by a jump (30 °C min$^{-1}$), to a final temperature of 300 °C.
The column outlet was coupled to a Thermo Polaris-Q ion trap mass spectrometer (Polaris Q; Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, California) operated at 70 eV in (electron ionization) EI mode.
The transfer line was heated to 270 °C, and source temperature held at 200 °C.
Live, litter, roots, O- and A-horizon samples were analyzed with py-GC/MS, but the A-horizon samples were not included with TMAH.

## Data Analysis

Products were identified with reference spectra after de-convolution and identification based on the primary characteristic ions (for example, @Buurman2007) using AMDIS v 2.64 and National Institute of Standards and Technology 2002 mass spectral libraries.
Each spectrum was inspected manually.
All the identified components with a signal intensity greater than 0.5% of the spectra were selected using a Matlab script (version 7) to ensure data quality.
Requiring a high signal-to-noise ratio for peak identification increased the probability of correct compound identification.
Using this method, we identified more than 80% of the peaks in a given spectra.
The data are quantitatively expressed as relative intensity with respect to total measured intensity (for example, @Vancampenhout2009).
Relative intensity (RI) is expressed as

$$ RI_{ij} = ( \frac{x_{ij}}{\sum x_i} ) 100 $$

where $x_{ij}$ is the total integrated area for compound $j$ in sample $i$, and $\sum x_i$ is the sum of all identified compounds.

Compound identification and classification were done according to probable source using the published literature (for example, @Hempfling1990; @Chiavari1992; @Gutierrez1995; @Hatcher1995; @Galletti1997; @delRio1998, @delRio2007; @Moldoveanu1998; @Gleixner1999, @Gleixner2002; @Chefetz2002; @Filley2002; @Gauthier2002).
During source classification, compounds were grouped into six source categories including lignin, polysaccharide, lipids, N-bearing, phenols, aromatic, and unidentified, based on the literature (Appendix 1, 2 in Supplemental Material).
Classification included all the compounds identifiable by spectra.
Of the compounds extracted, compounds which could not be assigned to a source category comprised fewer than 5% of the spectra.
Summing relative intensities of py-GC/MS does not yield comparable results to wet-chemical analyses for whole plant content, but is useful, like the molecular mixing model with $^{13}$C NMR data, to interpret general differences in bulk chemistry content [@Kaal2007; @Baldock2004].
Evaluation of total sample chemistry by groups (lignin, lipid, polysaccharide, N-bearing) was performed on unmethylated data [@Kaal2007]; due to the more complete chemical characterization that includes N-bearing compounds and polysaccharides [@RaabUnpublishedb].
Differences between soils were expressed as a proportion of the summed differences in compound classes (Appendix 1 in Supplemental Material).
Methylated data were used to confirm the presence of lignin-derived acids and fatty-acids.

The origin of compound groups cannot be assigned plant versus microbial origin unequivocally except for lignins, but individual compounds can be biomarkers of plant (above and belowground) and more processed C sources.
Lignin biomarkers are entirely of plant-origin (guaiacyl, syringyl, and *p*-hydroxyphenyl groups), as are odd numbered long-chained alkenes from plant waxes.
Even chained fatty acid methyl esters can indicate cutin versus suberin sources.
Smaller-chained lipids are primarily of microbial origin.
Some polysaccharide biomarkers that are indicative of plant cellulose [@Steinbeiss2006] can be distinguished from those of more microbial processed products, although some compounds, may be derived from both sources (for example, @Moldoveanu1998).
Some pyrolysis products have multiple origins, such as tannins and some types of lignins [@Nierop2007], whereas phenols may be derived from lignin or protein sources and have been separated into their own category (Appendix 1).

## Statistics

The chemistry of the soil fractions was evaluated using principle component analysis (PCA) with a correlation matrix to account for differences in variance between chemical groups in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
Results were orthogonally rotated using Proc FACTOR to correlate components with variables and consequently to provide the most interpretable results.
We used categorical groupings based on probable origin and included lignin, lipid, phenol, polysaccharide, aromatic, N-bearing, and unidentified categories (Appendix 1).
Soil C and N were analyzed using an ANOVA.
To explain variation between angiosperm versus fern biomarkers, we performed a PCA analysis with a correlation matrix on each class of compounds present in the major chemical classes [lignin (13), polysaccharide (17), lipid (14), and aromatic (11)] (Appendix 1).
