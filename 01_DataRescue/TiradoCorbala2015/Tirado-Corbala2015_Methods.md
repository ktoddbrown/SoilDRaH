# 2. Materials and Methods

## 2.1. Study Area

The study was conducted on a commercial sugarcane plantation (CSP) on the island of Maui, Hawaii (20°54′ N and 156°26′ W).
We selected two, ~1 ha experimental plots with contrasting soil types: Pulehu series-cobbly silt loam (fine-loamy, mixed semiactive, isohyperthermic Cumulic Haplustolls) and Molokai series-silty clay loam (Very-fine, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Typic Eutrotorrox) [@Soil2013].
These soils were selected because both are common soil series encountered in Maui’s agricultural lands.
Both plots were planted with four different commercial sugarcane cultivars, H65-7052, H78-3567, H86-3792 and H87-4319.
The Pulehu series plot was planted on 19 July 2011 and harvested on 9 June 2013.
A total of 375 kg of N ha$^{−1}$ in the form of Urea (46% N) was applied in 7 applications in the first 300 days after planting (DAP).
The Molokai series plot was planted on 23 June 2011 and harvested on 7 May 2013.
A total of 345 kg of N ha$^{−1}$, in the form of Urea, was applied in 10 applications in the first 300 DAP.
The CSP uses drip irrigation to supplement rain and tried to maximize limited surface and ground water resources [@Moore1990].
The drip irrigation system consists of drip laterals spaced at 2.74 m intervals with a row of sugarcane planted on both sides of each drip tape at 46 cm distance away from the tape.
The system is pressure compensated to 82.7 kPa (12 pounds per square inch) at risers at the head of the tape lines.
The discharge rate is 1.58 L/hour/meter of tape (12.7 US gallons/ hour/ 100 feet of tape).
In total 2500 mm of water was drip-applied during the two-year growth cycle.

## 2.2. Baseline Soil Properties of the Experimental Plots

At the beginning of the experiment, 12 samples were collected randomly from each soil depth (0–20, 20–40, 40–80 and 80–120 cm) from the both Pulehu and Molokai soils, oven dried at 65 °C for 48 h, ground and sieved through a 2-mm screen.
Soil pH was measured in 1:1 solid/DI water suspension [@Thomas1996].
Electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil samples was determined from a 1:1 soil: DI water suspension.
Exchangeable macronutrients such as Calcium (Ca$^{2+}$), Magnesium (Mg$^{2+}$), Potassium (K$^+$) and Sodium (Na$^+$) were measured using 1-molar ammonium acetate (NH$_4$OAc) as the extractant (pH 7) [@Bouyoucos1962] and determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry analysis (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA. (Mention of trade names or commercial products in this publication is solely for the purpose of providing specific information and does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the U.S. Department of Agriculture).
Soil texture was determined by the hydrometer method [@Warncke1998].
Soil bulk density was determined by using a 5.7 cm diameter bulk density soil sampler (0200 Soil Core Sampler from Soil Moisture Equipment Corp., Ventura, CA, USA).

## 2.3. Soil Variables

In each experimental plot, three samples from each soil depth (0–20, 20–40, 40–80 and 80–120 cm) and sugarcane cultivar were collected at tillering, grand growth, and maturity sugarcane growing stages, oven dried at 65 °C for 48 h, ground and sieved through a 2-mm screen.
Total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents were determined by dry combustion with a Flash 2000 N and C Soil Analyzer (Thermo Scientific®, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
Organic carbon (OC) was determined after eliminating all the inorganic carbon (IC) in the samples in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), after the samples were acidified with 1:1 HCL: DI water in silver container.
The soluble organic compounds were then dried and combusted using the Flash 2000 N and C Soil Analyzer (Thermo Scientific®, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
IC was determined by subtracting OC from the TC.
Soil carbon and nitrogen stocks (kg·m$^{−2}$) were calculated by multiplying the carbon concentration by the thickness of the soil layer (m) and the soil bulk density (kg·m$^{−3}$) for each layer.

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was determined after saturating the soil with DI water (1:1 soil:DI water) for 24 h, shaken for one hour on a reciprocal shaker, and filtered through a Whatman no. 42 filter.
Carbon recovered in the water extract was determined using a Fusion Total Organic Carbon Analyzer TM (Teledyne Tekmar, Mason, OH).
Nitrate (NO$_3$-N) content (1:1 soil: DI water) was determined by using Nitrate-Nitrite Astoria Pacific 2 analyzer (Portland, OR, USA).

## 2.4. Plant Measurements

In each experimental plot, plant samples from three locations per sugarcane cultivar were collected to measure aboveground and belowground biomass less than two weeks prior to harvest.
Aboveground biomass was determined by using two m2 rectangular frames.
The long dimension (2 m) of the frame was installed along the row.
With the aboveground measurements, we only considered the biomass from the cane stalks growing inside the frame (i.e., green tops, dried leaves and trash on the ground) because sugarcane tends to lodge.
Before cutting the cane, the plant height and dewlap of three representative sugarcane plants were measured.
Aboveground dry biomass was determined after oven drying the samples at 65 °C for 5 days.
Aboveground dry biomass samples were shipped to our laboratory and ground to 2 mm size particles using a grinder (Thomas Scientific 174931 grinder, Swedesboro, NJ, USA).
Lignin content analysis of the different sugarcane cultivars was conducted at an independent laboratory (the Soil, Water, and Forage Testing Laboratory at Texas A and M Agri Life Extension Service College Station, TX, USA).

Belowground (root) biomass was measured at the time when aboveground biomass was sampled.
Root biomass for each soil depth interval (0–20, 20–40, 40–80 and 80–120 cm) was determined after collecting soil samples at intervals of 0 m (next to the cane row), 0.75 m and 1.5 m from the sugarcane row using a 7 cm diameter mud auger (Signature Series 350.19, AMS Inc., American Falls, ID, USA).
Probe method (mud auger) was selected to minimize disturbance to the soil.
All soil samples were stored in plastic containers and were frozen in preparation for root sieving.
After thawing, soils were hand sieved by using a 1.4 mm mesh sieve (# 14) to ensure the collection of the majority of the roots.
Collected roots from each sample were oven dried overnight at 65 °C to determine root dry weight.

## 2.5. Statistical Analysis

The treatments were arranged in randomized complete design that included four sugarcane cultivars and at two soil types.
For each experimental plot (Molokai and Pulehu) and sugarcane cultivar, soil samples were collected at matching sugarcane growing stages (tillering, grand growth and maturity).
The soil results from the growing stages for each cultivar were compared for: TC, OC, IC, DOC, TN and NO$_3$-N.
Plant samples from all the sugarcane cultivars, collected two weeks prior harvest, were compared for aboveground biomass and lignin content.
The data were analyzed using the Mixed model of JMP Version 10 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by means separation using Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test at Pr < 0.05 was utilized to examine the significant differences among cultivars and between soil types in soil chemical properties and other variables.
