"Figure 3. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Pulehu soils. Color represents sugarcane growing stages (i.e., blue-tillering, yellow-grand growth, green-maturity) when the soil samples were collected. Means followed by the same letter or no letters for the bars in each soil depth are not significantly different Tukey’s test at Pr < 0.05.",,,,,
