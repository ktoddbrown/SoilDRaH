# METHODS

## *Study sites*

The sites are on the northeast flank of Mauna Kea volcano in the Laupahoehoe Forest Reserve and the adjacent Waipunalei tract.
They consist of native *Metrosideros polymorpha* dominated rain forest (C<sub>3</sub>) that ranges from 700 to 1700 m elevation, and of adjacent pastures, dominated by the African C<sub>4</sub> grass *Pennisetum clandestinum*, that were converted from this forest several decades ago.
The pastures extend below the forest to sea level, and both forest and pasture sites can be found at all elevations on the same soil type.
These soils are andisols, classified in the 1965 Hawaii Soil Survey as typic distrandepts, and all are derived from what is known in Hawaii as "Pahala Ash," a generic term for a series of large volcanic ash falls occurring between 12000 and 20000 yr ago [@Peterson1987].
Although different ash falls can vary both physically and chemically, there is little variation in a single large event like the one that covered our sites [@Peterson1987].

Mean annual rainfall varies from 2000 to 3000 mm, with a positive water balance at all elevations throughout the year [@Juvik1978]; therefore all soils are in a udic moisture regime and the gradient is essentially one of temperature, with a decrease in mean annual temperature of 9.4°C from the lowest pasture site at 100 m to the highest at 1700 m.
We selected five main sites along this gradient: pastures at 100, 800, and 1700 m, and forests at 900 and 1500 m.
The uppermost two pastures were 40-50 yr old, and the lowest was ≈100 yr old.
We also selected two pastures at 800 m elevation that were ≈10-15 yr old and 15-27 yr old.
The ages were determined by using air photos of the region taken in 1977, 1965, and 1954, and by talking with local landowners.

With the exception of stream cuts, the topography on a shield volcano such as Mauna Kea is quite consistent; all five sites were relatively level at a given altitude and all had a gradual slope towards the sea.
Soil depth to older substrate was at least 1 m in all sites.
To check our assumption that soil type was similar, we measured soil pH in CaCl<sub>2</sub> and in NaF of samples taken at 0, 20, 40, and 60 cm in each of the five sites.
NaF pH is used as an index of allophane activity [@Fieldes1966, @Uehara1981].
Soil pH values in both solutions were slightly lower at 0 cm in the forests (presumably due to surface litter), but overall values were extremely similar among the five sites (Fig. 1).

## *Soil carbon*

With the exception of the samples for carbon-14, all soils were collected with a 5 x 20 cm corer.
In each site, 15 cores were collected randomly along three 100-m transects.
Sample sizes were between 100 and 200 g (dry mass), and all samples were passed through a 2-mm mesh sieve, after which any remaining root fragments were removed manually.
The soils were then oven dried at 100°C, and kept at room temperature for analysis.
Carbon contents were determined by combustion in a Carlo-Erba C/N analyzer; all samples were analyzed 2 or 3 times.

## *Soil respiration*

CO<sub>2</sub> evolved from the soils in the field was determined using the soda lime technique [@Raich1990].
Approximately 60 g of soda lime in metal tins was dried at 100°C for 24 h immediately before sampling, then weighed and sealed.
Fifteen plastic chambers per site (33 cm diameter) were covered with aluminum foil, placed on the soil, and pushed in slightly to form a seal once all vegetation was clipped at the soil surface in the area encompassed by the chambers.
The chambers were then removed, and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min.
The soda lime tins were then opened and placed in the center of the cleared areas, the chambers were gently reinserted into the soil, and rocks were placed on top to keep the seal intact.
Three tins per site were collected immediately and resealed to serve as blanks.

After 24 h, the chambers were removed and the remaining tins collected and sealed.
A temperature probe was inserted ≈2-3 cm beneath the soil surface in all chamber locations, and soil temperatures were recorded.
Soil cores were taken from within each chamber site and homogenized by hand.
Subsamples were then taken from the homogenized cores, weighed, dried for 48 h at 100°C, and reweighed to determine soil moisture.
The soda lime tins were dried at 100°C for 24 h and weighed; the difference between pre- and postsampling masses was assumed to be due to the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbed during sampling.
Sampling was done 6 times between November 1991 and September 1992.
Values were converted to grams of carbon per square metre per day; annual values were computed by averaging all sampling days.

## *Carbon-13 of soils and vegetation*

Homogenized samples of soil or vegetation were combusted in a sealed quartz tube with CuO at 900°C.
The evolved CO<sub>2</sub> was released under vacuum and purified by trapping in liquid nitrogen; it was then analyzed for <sup>13</sup>C on a mass spectrometer (Finnigan Delta E) fitted with a triple-ion collector and dual inlet system that allows rapid switching between reference and sample.
Results are expressed in $\delta^{13} \text{C permil}$ units:
$\delta^{13} \text{C permil} = (^{13}R \text{sample}/ ^{13} R \text{standard} - 1) \times 1000 $, (1)
where $^{13}R$ = $^{13}C/^{12}C$.
The reference was calibrated using the standard NSB19, and results are expressed vs. Pee Dee Belemnite.
All samples were run at the Stable Isotope Ratio Facility for Environmental Research at the University of Utah; analytical precision was ±0.1 permille.

## *Carbon-13 of soil respiration*

Glass Wheaton jars (30-cm<sup>3</sup>) were annealed at 300°C, sealed with red rubber Wheaton septa that had been boiled for 2 h, and then evacuated and sealed with Apiezon N grease.
Plastic chambers fitted with Swagelok valves were connected to Teflon tubing equipped with clamps.
The clamps were closed, chambers were placed over bare soil (see *Soil respiration* above), and CO<sub>2</sub> was allowed to accumulate within the chamber for 30 min.
A Luer-Lock syringe was then attached to the free end of the tubing, the clamp was opened, and a 30-cm<sup>3</sup> sample was taken by drawing and plunging the syringe 3 times before locking the syringe valve.

A 22G surgical needle was then placed on the syringe and pushed through the thick portion of the Wheaton jar septa.
All of the gas was plunged into the jar, the needle removed, and the septa again sealed with grease.
We found that extracting samples through a needle directly from the chamber into the syringe can cause fractionation of > 3 permille; needles should be used only when the entire volume of gas is being transferred.
The CO<sub>2</sub> in the samples was extracted and purified under vacuum, and then analyzed on a Nuclide 6-60 mass spectrometer in David Des Marais' laboratory at NASA/Ames Research Center.
Values are calibrated and reported as described in the preceding sectionl analytical precision was ± 0.1 permille.
All <sup>13</sup>C values for soil respiration are reported minus the fraction due to atmospheric <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>, determined by measuring the isotopic signature of eight atmospheric samples taken at each of the five sites, and by assuming the mean value from each site applied to 355 µL/L of the CO<sub>2</sub> in the chamber samples.
The mean (± 1SE) for all five sites was -8.9 ± 1.4 permille.

## *Carbon-14*

Two 1 m deep soil pits were dug at each site; soil samples were collected at 20-cm increments to 1 m from the wall of the pit.
These samples were taken by scraping free 2-3 cm from the surface of the walls to avoid contamination caused by digging, and then scraping an additional amount on to a clean trowel.
Soils were processed and combusted in a quartz tube as described above; the resultant CO<sub>2</sub> was then analyzed for both <sup>13</sup>C (as above) and <sup>14</sup>C.
<sup>14</sup>C was measured using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS; @Trumbore1993).
The CO<sub>2</sub> was catalytically reduced to graphite AMS targets [@Vogel1987], and measurements were made at the Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
$\delta^{13} \text{C}$ corrections were made using results from the same samples.
Values are expressed as Δ<sup>14</sup>C, the deviation in parts per thousand of the $^{14}C/^{12}C$ ratio in the sample from that of an absolute standard (oxalic acid decay corrected to 1950, @Stuiver1977).
The values reported here are averages of the 0 and 20 cm samples, weighted by their respective carbon contents.

## *Microbial biomass*

The microbial biomass for each site was estimated using the chloroform fumigation technique [@Jenkinson1976].
Ten 10-g samples of soil per site were fumigated in 100-mL beakers in a vacuum dessicator for 24 h; the beakers were then removed from the desiccator and placed into mason jars for 20 d.
CO<sub>2</sub> evolved from the soils over days 1-10 and 11-20 was measured using base trap vials containing 5 mL of 1 mol/L NaOH [@Coleman1977].
The vials were removed following each sampling period, BaCl was added to precipitate out the CO<sub>2</sub> in solution, and each vial was titrated with 1 mol/L HCl.
Five vials were placed in empty mason jars to serve as blanks.
Microbial biomass C was computed using the equation of @Chaussod1982:
$\text{Mic C} = \frac{(\text{C evolved days 1-10} - \text{C evolved days 10-20})}{k}$, (2)
where $k$ is the fraction of the carbon in the killed biomass that is mineralized to CO<sub>2</sub> under the conditions of incubation.
We used a value of 0.45 [@Jenkinson1981].

## *SOM fractionation*

We attempted to separate bulk soil into fractions with different turnover times via two fractionation schemes.
The first was a physical procedure described in full by @Cambardella1994, in which the soils were dispersed in sodium hexametaphosphate for 16 h and then passed through a 53-µm mesh sieve.
The second was a chemical procedure described by @Trumbore1991, in which the soils received alternating applications of HCl and NaOH [@Trumbore1991].
The <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>13</sup>C values of each fraction were then determined.

## *Century model*

Simulations of carbon dynamics of all five sites were done with the Century Soil Organic Matter model, which is described in detail in @Parton1987, @Parton1988.
This model has been applied widely to both grassland and forest sites, has been validated extensively against sites in the Great Plains, and most recently, against a worldwide set of grassland sites [@Parton1993].
Existing parameter files for an evergreen rain forest and a tropical grassland were modified to represent the climate, and litter and vegetation chemistry of the sites.
Where possible, parameter values were taken from data collected in or near the sites; otherwise best estimates from the literature were used.

Century's default structure causes fine-textured soils to retain a substantial fraction of rainfall.
The allophanic soils in these sites are fine textured but macroporous so that the high rainfall in the sites does not cause the soils to flood.
Consequently, we decreased the model's fraction of rainfall that is stored by 30% so that both texture and drainage were reasonable.
Monthly mean temperatures and rainfall for each site were taken from @Giambelluca1986 and @Armstrong1983, and the model was run to equilibrium for each site.
Final equilibrium values for respiration, soil carbon, and SOM turnover are reported here.
