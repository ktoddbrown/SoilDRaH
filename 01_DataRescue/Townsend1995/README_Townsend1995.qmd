# Data Summary

This paper looks at soil organic carbon stock and radiocarbon age across a gradient of three elevations of two land uses (pasture and forested). They use this data to fit soil carbon pools in a three pool first order linear model.

## Fit for purpose: HiCSC

This data is identified as a data source for the Hawai'i Soil Organic Carbon Database https://osf.io/hmtv6/ as part of the HiCSC.

- Location: The methods section in this paper does not have specific latitude/longitude of the sites but does give detailed regional descriptions which could be used to infer specific latitude and longitude. Year of observation is given in text.
- Soil carbon stock: Depth of sample and area-density of soil organic carbon is given, unclear how coarse fraction was corrected for or bulk density assessed.
- Soil type: Detailed classification provided in methods section.
- Land use: Detailed land use and land use history in the methods section.

# Tables and figures

- Table 
  1) Soil carbon, respiration, biomass, radiocarbon, pasture age, and forest-derived SOC
  2) Seasonal variation in soil respiration, temperature, and moisture
  3) Model performance summary
  4) Modeled pool size
  5) Soil incubation cumulative totals
  6) Estimated passive pool
  7) Model sensitivity results

- Figure 
  1) Soil pH values
  2) Pasture age vs radiocarbon
  3) Soil depth vs age
  4) Pasture site vs forest-derived carbon
  5) Modeled vs observed 13C
  6) Half-life of intermediate SOM vs mean annual temperature
  
### Table 1

Table 1 was modified by replacing delta symbols with text as well as removing superscripts *a*, *b*, and *c* denoting values used in the results section for an equation.

```{r}
#| label: read_Table1
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false

read_csv(file = table1.file,
                   skip = 1,
                   col_types = cols(.default = col_character())) |>
  kable(caption = read_csv(file = table1.file, 
                                 n_max = 1, col_names = 'caption', 
                                 show_col_types = FALSE)$caption)
```

### Table 2

Table 2 was modified by combining grouped headings into column/header names.

```{r}
#| label: readTable2
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false

read_csv(file = table2.file,
                   skip = 1,
                   col_types = cols(.default = col_character())) |>
  kable(caption = read_csv(file = table2.file, 
                                 n_max = 1, col_names = 'caption', 
                                 show_col_types = FALSE)$caption)
```


## Methods

```{bash}
#| label: compareTranscriptions
#| eval: false

# You will want to repeat the line below to cross check each csv and md file in the
#... data rescue. Having no lines flagged by this command will ensure that each character matches exactly.
diff --strip-trailing-cr --suppress-common-lines -y Scowcroft2004_Methods.md  Scowcroft2004_Methods_AW.md

diff --strip-trailing-cr --suppress-common-lines -y Scowcroft2004_Table1.csv Scowcroft2004_Table1_AW.csv

```

Any different to the cross check for the methods section will be output after this line.

### Methods  - Text

The final text transcription from the Methods section is rendered below.

```{r}
#| label: readMethods
#| output: asis
#| eval: true

# This revised section will append two ### to any existing headers here so that it renders nicely with the other headers in the document.

methodsLines <- readLines(methods.file) |>
  str_replace_all(pattern = '^#', replacement = '####')

cat(paste0(methodsLines, collapse = '\n'))

```
