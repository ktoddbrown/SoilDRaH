	abstract = {We tested the Walker and Syers (1976) conceptual model of soil development and its ecological implications by analyzing changes in soil P, vegetation, and other ecosystem properties on a soil chronosequence with six sites ranging in age from 300 yr to 4.1 x 10 6 yr. Climate, dominant vegetation, slope, and parent material of all of the sites were similar. As fractions of total P, the various pools of soil phosphorus behaved very much as predicted by Walker and Syers. HCI—extractable P (presumably primary mineral phosphates) comprised 82\% of total P at the 300—yr—old site, and then decreased to 1\% at the 20,000—yr—old site. Organic phosphorus increased from the youngest site to a maximum at the 150 000 yr site, and then declined to the 4.1 x 10 6 yr site. Occluded (residual) P increased steadily with soil age. In contrast to the Walker and Syers model, we found the highest total P at the 150 000—yr—old site, rather than at the onset of soil development, and we found that the non—occluded, inorganic P fraction persisted through to the oldest chronosequence site. Total soil N and C increased substantially from early to middle soil development in parallel with organic P, and then declined through to the oldest site. Readily available soil P, NH4+, and NO3— were measured using anion and cation exchange resin bags. P availability increased and decreased unimodally across the chronosequence. NH4+ and NO3— pools increased through early soil development, but did not systematically decline late in soil development. In situ decomposition rates of Metrosideros polymorpha litter were highest at two intermediate—aged sites with soil fertility (20 000 yr and 150 000 yr), and lowest at the less—fertile beginning (300 yr) and endpoint (4.1 x 10 6 yr) of the chronosequence. M. polymorpha leaves collected from these same four sites, and decomposed in a common site, suggested that leaves from intermediate—aged sites were inherently more decomposable than those from the youngest and oldest sites. Both litter tissue quality and the soil environment appeared to influence rates of decomposition directly. The highest mean soil N2O emissions (809 mg°m—2°d—1) were measured at the 20 000—yr—old site, which also had the highest soil nitrogen fertility status. Plant communities at all six chronosequence sites were dominated primarily by M. Polymorpha, and to a lesser extent by several other genera of trees and shrubs. There were, however, differences in overall vegetation community composition among the sites. Using a detrended correspondence analysis (DECORANA), we found that a high proportion of species variance among the sites (eigenvalue = 0.71) can be explained by site age and thus soil developmental stage. Overall, long—term soil development across the chronosequence largely coincides with the conceptual model of Walker and Syers (1976). How P is distributed among different organic and inorganic fractions at a given stage of soil development provides a useful context of evaluating contemporary cycling of P and other nutrients, and for determining how changes in P availability might affect diverse ecosystem processes.},

	abstract = {Patterns of nitrogen trace gas emissions, soil nitrogen flux, and nutrient availability were evaluated at five sites that form a chronosequence in Hawaiian montane rain forest. The estimated age of basaltic parent material from which soils developed at the Kilauea site was 200 yr, 6000 yr at the Puu Makaala site, 185 000 yr at the Kohala site, 1.65 ° 10 6 yr at the Molokai site, and 4.5 ° 10 6 yr at the Kauai site. Peak net N mineralization and nitrification values were found in soils from the 185 000—yr—old Kohala site. Nitrogen content of foliage and leaf litter was highest in the intermediate age sites (Puu Makaala and Kohala) and N and P retranslocation was lowest at the Puu Makaala site. Soil cores fertilized with nitrogen had significantly higher rates of root ingrowth than control cores at the two youngest sites (200 and 6000 yr old) but not in older sites (185 000 and 4.5 ° 10 6—yr—old sites) and total fine root growth into control cores was greatest at the Kohala site. The highest N2O emissions were found at the 185 000—yr—old Kohala site, while the highest combined flux of N2O + NO was observed at the 4.5 ° 10 6—yr—old Kauai site. While overall N2O emission rates were correalted with rates of N transformations, soil water content appeared to influence the magnitude of emissions of N2O and the ratios of emissions of NO vs. N2O. N2O emissions occurred when water—filled pore space (WFPS) values were {\textgreater}40\%, with highest emissions in at least two sites observed at WFPS values of 75\%. Among sites, high NO emissions were associated with high soil N transformation rates. Large NO fluxes were observed only at the Kauai site when WFPS values were {\textless}60\%.},

              The small-subunit ribosomal DNA (rDNA) diversity was found to be very high in a Hawaiian soil community that might be expected to have lower diversity than the communities in continental soils because the Hawaiian soil is geographically isolated and only 200 years old, is subjected to a constant climate, and harbors low plant diversity. Since an underlying community structure could not be revealed by analyzing the total eubacterial rDNA, we first fractionated the DNA on the basis of guanine-plus-cytosine (G+C) content by using bis-benzimidazole and equilibrium centrifugation and then analyzed the bacterial rDNA amplified from a fraction with a high biomass (63\% G+C fraction) and a fraction with a low biomass (35\% G+C fraction). The rDNA clone libraries were screened by amplified rDNA restriction analysis to determine phylotype distribution. The dominant biomass reflected by the 63\% G+C fraction contained several dominant phylotypes, while the community members that were less successful (35\% G+C fraction) did not show dominance but there was a very high diversity of phylotypes. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed taxa belonging to the groups expected for the G+C contents used. The dominant phylotypes in the 63\% G+C fraction were members of the
              Pseudomonas
              ,
              Rhizobium-Agrobacterium
              , and
              Rhodospirillum
              assemblages, while all of the clones sequenced from the 35\% G+C fraction were affiliated with several
              Clostridium
              assemblages. The two-step rDNA analysis used here uncovered more diversity than can be detected by direct rDNA analysis of total community DNA. The G+C separation step is also a way to detect some of the less dominant organisms in a community.},

One pair of primers is capable of amplifying nearly full-length 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) from many bacterial genera; the additional primers are useful for various exceptional sequences. Methods for purification of amplified material, direct sequencing, cloning, sequencing, and transcription are outlined. An obligate intracellular parasite of bovine erythrocytes, Anaplasma marginale, is used as an example; its 16S rDNA was amplified, cloned, sequenced, and phylogenetically placed. Anaplasmas are related to the genera Rickettsia and Ehrlichia. In addition, 16S rDNAs from several species were readily amplified from material found in lyophilized ampoules from the American Type Culture Collection. By use of this method, the phylogenetic study of extremely fastidious or highly pathogenic bacterial species can be carried out without the need to culture them. In theory, any gene segment for which polymerase chain reaction primer design is possible can be derived from a readily obtainable lyophilized bacterial culture.},

            Determining the structure of bacterial communities and their response to stimuli is key to understanding community function and the interactions that occur between microorganisms and the environment. However, bacterial communities often comprise complex assemblages of large numbers of different bacterial populations. An approach is presented which allows bacterial community structure to be determined by fractionation of the complex mixture of total bacterial community DNA using the DNA‐binding dye bisbenzimidazole which imposes G + C‐dependent changes in the buoyant density of DNA. Bacterial community structure presented as percentage of total DNA vs. percentage G + C content of DNA is an indication of the relative abundance of phylogenetic groups of bacteria. Changes in the composition of a soil bacterial community in response to perturbations in the form of carbon amendment and altered water status were monitored.},

	abstract = {Genomic DNA was isolated from the active layer of tundra soil collected from the Kolyma lowland. Northeast Eurasia, near the Arctic Ocean coast. The SSU (small subunit) rRNA genes were amplified with eubacterial primers from the bulk genomic community DNA and cloned into plasmid vectors. Forty-three SSU rDNA clones were obtained, and all of them had different RFLP patterns. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequences (about 300 bp) established with the maximum likelihood method revealed the presence of three major and several minor groups that fell into 11 of the established lines of bacteria, and one sequence that could not be assigned to any of the described groups. Most of the clones belonged to the alpha (20.9\%) and delta (25.6\%) subdivisions of the
              Proteobacteria,
              with lesser proportions in the beta (9.3\%) and gamma (4.7\%) subdivisions, groups typically isolated from soil by culture methods. Fewer than 12\% of the clones belonged to Gram-positive bacteria, and 16\% of the clones were related to
              Fibrobacter.
              The majority of the clones (70\%) had sequences that were 5-15\% different from those in the current databases, and 7\% of the clones had sequences that differed by more than 20\% from those in the database. The results suggest that these tundra-derived clones are very diverse in phylogeny, and that many probably reflect new genera or families. Hence, most of the tundra soil bacterial community has never been isolated and thus the physiology and function of its dominant members appears to be unknown.},

	abstract = {A new computational method (chimeric alignment) has been developed to detect chimeric 16S rRNA artifacts generated during PCR amplification from mixed bacterial populations. In contrast to other nearest-neighbor methods (e.g., CHECK\_CHIMERA) that define sequence similarity by k-tuple matching, the chimeric alignment method uses the score from dynamic programming alignments. Further, the chimeric alignments are displayed to the user to assist in sequence classification. The distribution of improvement scores for 500 authentic, nonchimeric sequences and 300 artificial chimeras (constructed from authentic sequences) was used to study the sensitivity and accuracy of both chimeric alignment and CHECK\_CHIMERA. At a constant rate of authentic sequence misclassification (5\%), chimeric alignment incorrectly classified 13\% of the artificial chimeras versus 14\% for CHECK\_CHIMERA. Interestingly, only 1\% of nonchimeras and 10\% of chimeras were misclassified by both programs, suggesting that optimum performance is obtained by using the two methods to assign sequences to three classes: high-probability nonchimeras, high-probability chimeras, and sequences that need further study by other means. This study suggests that k-tuple-based matching methods are more sensitive than alignment-based methods when there is significant parental sequence similarity, while the opposite becomes true as the sequences become more distantly related.
