"Figure 1. Aggregated SOC changes (kg C m$^{-2}$ y$^{-1}$) since plantation establishment across the four study sites. The error bars are standard errors of the mean using *n* = 4 for non–N–fixer species and *n* = 6 for the N–fixer species. The P values are for the test of the species-within-block split-plot effect.",,,,,
