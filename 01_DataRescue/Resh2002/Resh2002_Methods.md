## Study Sites

The study sites consisted of 7- to 16-year-old plantations of N–fixers and *Eucalyptus* species (non–N–fixers) with three to six replicated plots of each species at each site (Table 1).
At the Hawaii sites, the plantation species were *Albizia falcataria* (L.) Fosberg (also known as *Paraserianthes falcataria* (L.) Nielsen and *Falcataria moluccana* (Miquel) Barneby & Grimes) and *Eucalyptus saligna* (Sm.).
At the Puerto Rico sites, the plantation species were *Casuarina equisetifolia* (L.), *Leucaena leucocephala* (Lam.) de Wit variety K636, and *Eucalyptus robusta* J.E. Smith.
*Albizia* and *Leucaena* belong to the Fabaceae, subfamily Mimosoideae, and *Casuarina* belongs to the Casuarinaceae.

*Albizia* is nodulated by the *Rhizobia* and *Bradyrhizobia* bacteria and also hosts vesicular–arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) [@Turk1992].
*Albizia* is native to the eastern islands of the Indonesian archipelago and is widely grown in tropical plantations for fuel, pulp, and light construction [@Binkley1997].
*Albizia* trees grow very rapidly to 25–30 m tall and up to 1 m in diameter at rates of 6–18 Mg ha$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$ of stem increment with N–fixing rates of 65–140 kg N ha$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$ [@Little1989; @Binkley1997].

*Leucaena* is nodulated by *Rhizobia* bacteria and hosts VAM [@Binkley1997].
*Leucaena* is native to Central America, and *Leucaena leucocephala* is planted extensively in tropical plantations for fuel, roundwood, pulp and paper, and soil improvement [@Parrotta1992; @Zabala1997].
*Leucaena* trees grow rapidly up to 20 m in height and 0.5 m in diameter with aboveground biomass production of 5–55 Mg ha$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$ [@Parrotta1992] and N–fixation rates of 70–150 kg N ha$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$ [@Little1989; @Parrotta1996; @Binkley1997].

*Casuarina* is nodulated by *Frankia* actinomycetes and also hosts VAM and ectomycorrhizae [@Binkley1997].
*Casuarina* is native to Australia, Malaysia, and Polynesia [@Subbarao1995].
It is grown throughout the tropics for land reclamation, sand dune stabilization, and wind breaks, as well as timber [@Parrotta1993; @Binkley1997].
*Casuarina* grows to 30–40 m tall and 0.5 m in diameter with wood increments on good sites of 10–15 Mg ha$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$ and N–fixation rates of 60–95 kg N ha$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$ in pure stands [@Parrotta1993; @Parrotta1994, @Parrotta1996; @Subbarao1995; @Binkley1997].

The two species of *Eucalyptus* are native to southeastern Australia.
Both species may grow to 40–60 or more m in height and diameters of 1.2 m or more.
*E. robusta* grows well in Puerto Rico and was also planted extensively in Hawaii until the 1960s, when planting shifted to *E. saligna* and *E. grandis*.
*Eucalyptus* wood is used for housing, pulp, fuel, charcoal, and pallets [@Little1989].

The Hawaii study sites are located on the northeast coast of Hawaii (Table 1).
These sites are described in greater detail as “Upper Kamae” and “Chinchuck” in @Binkley1997 and @Garcia-Montiel1998.
In the 1920s, both sites were converted from wildland forest (C$_3$ species) to sugarcane (*Saccharum officinarum*) (C$_4$ species).
Sugarcane production at the Kamae site was abandoned in 1960 due to low production.
Sugarcane production at the Chinchuck site continued until 1980.
In 1981, old vegetation was cleared on both sites, soils were plowed, and new growth was treated with herbicide.
In 1982, pure species trials of *Albizia* and *Eucalyptus* were planted in a randomized complete block design with four blocks (eight plots total).
The trees were planted at a spacing of 1.5 $\times$ 1.5 m in 12 $\times$ 18 m plots for both *Albizia* and *Eucalyptus* at the Kamae site and at a spacing of 2 $\times$ 2 m in 15 by 30 $\times$ plots for *Albizia* and 30 $\times$ 30 m plots for *Eucalyptus* at the Chinchuck site, with no buffers between plots for either site.
These sites are within 1 km on similar soils, but they differed substantially in tree biomass and total soil N [@Garcia-Montiel1998].
Based on these differences, we treated the sites as independent units for statistical purposes.
At the time of soil sampling, the Kamae and Chinchuck tree plantations were 15 and 16 years old, respectively.

One Puerto Rico site is located in the Lajas Valley in southwest Puerto Rico (Table 1) [@Lugo1990; @Wang1991].
The site was plowed and treated with herbicide before planting.
In February 1980, seedlings of six taxa were planted in pure species plots; we used three of these for this study.
Weeding and fertilization were used for the first 6 months, and irrigation was applied when necessary to ensure initial survival.
Pure plots of *Casuarina*, *Leucaena*, and *Eucalyptus* were planted in a complete block design with six blocks.
The trees were planted at an original spacing of 1 $\times$ 1 m which was thinned to 2 $\times$ 2 m by age 1.5 years.
Plot size was 10 $\times$ 10 m with a 3-m buffer between plots and a 5-m buffer between blocks.
At the time of planting, the site was fallow following long-term sugarcane management.
When we sampled the plantation in December 1996, the area outside the plantation was dominated by a C$_4$ grass (*Panicum maximum*) with some herbaceous C$_3$ species.
Woody species have not dominated this site for the past 100 years prior to these tree plantations [@LugoUnpublished].
Trees were 16 years old at the time of sampling.

The second Puerto Rico site is located on the northern coast at the University of Puerto Rico’s Toa Baja experimental farm [@Parrotta1996; @Parrotta1999].
The site has had many disturbances that included leveling of the original forested dunes, sand extraction, and cultivation.
Pasture grasses, mostly *Panicum maximum*, were the dominant vegetation at plantation establishment.
Site preparation consisted of disking the soil to a depth of 20 cm.
The control plots, which remained in pasture grass, were also disked.
Pure and mixed plots of *Casuarina*, *Leucaena*, and *Eucalyptus* were established in a randomized complete block design with three blocks.
For this current study, only the pure species plots were used.
Trees were planted at a spacing of 1 $\times$ 1 m in 16 $\times$ 16 m plots.
There was a 5-m buffer between plots and blocks.
Recent samples (December 1996) and archived soils from just prior to tree plantation establishment were analyzed from this site.
Trees were 7 years old at the time of sampling.

## Sample Collection and Processing

We collected soil samples in January 1997 from Kamae, in January 1998 from Chinchuck, and in December 1996 from the Puerto Rico sites.
We used a 6-cm–diameter soil core lined with a butyrate plastic liner for soil sampling at the Hawaii and Lajas sites.
For soil sampling at the Toa Baja site, we used a 5.1-cm–diameter soil corer.
In each of the eight plots at the Kamae site, we collected one soil sample to a depth of 40 cm and two samples to a depth of 20 cm near the plot center in a triangular pattern 1 m apart.
Three 40-cm cores were collected from neighboring sugarcane fields to be analyzed as a proxy for pre-forest plantation conditions.
In each of the eight plots at the Chinchuck site, we collected two soil samples to a depth of 50 cm.
Data for neighboring sugarcane soil carbon was provided by @BashkinUnpublished.
In each of the 18 plots at the Lajas site, we collected one 40-cm soil sample near each plot center.
Control plots were located at the end of each of the six blocks, and a 40-cm soil sample was collected at least 5 m from the plantation edge to use as a proxy for pre-plantation conditions for this site.
The same sampling design used at Kamae was used for the Toa Baja plantation in Puerto Rico.
However, at this site, control plots of pre-plantation vegetation were included in the experimental design and were sampled in the same way as the forest soils; one 40-cm and two 20-cm samples were taken from each of the three control plots.

Upon collection, we immediately processed the Kamae, Chinchuck, and Toa Baja soils at a field lab.
Lajas soils were stored in the butyrate soil core liners for less than 5 days for transport back to Colorado State University (CSU) before processing.
In the lab, we divided all soils into 10-cm segments, with the exception of the Chinchuck soils, which we divided into 0–20- and 20–50-cm segments.
Where we had more than one sample per plot, we composited all soil samples into one sample per plot.
Roots larger than 2 mm were removed by hand before any analyses were done.
Bulk density (Table 2) was determined for each of the soil segments by over-drying a known fresh mass to a constant dry mass at 105°C; rock mass was negligible.

We treated the soils from Kamae and the two Puerto Rico sites with a 0.2N HCl wash to remove CaCO$_3$ that would affect $\delta$$^{13}$C values [@Ehleringer1991].
There was no evidence of CaCO$_3$ in the Chinchuck soils when 0.2N HCl solution was applied to 10 subsamples.
We oven-dried the soils at 105°C and ground them to flour texture for analysis of total C, N, and C isotopes.
Soil organic C and N concentrations (Table 2) were determined by dry combustion (LECO-1000; LECO Corporation, St. Joseph, MI, USA).
We corrected the C and N concentrations to account for the added salt mass from the acidification process.
The $\delta$$^{13}$C values of the soils were measured using a VG isochrom-NA stable isotopic ratio mass spectrometer (VG, Middlewich, UK).
The mass spectrometer is operated in automatic continuous flow mode using helium as the carrier gas after combustion.
The $\delta$$^{13}$C values, measured in ‰ (parts per thousand), were calculated as:

$$ \delta^{13}C = [(R_{sample}/R_{PDB}) - 1] \times 10^3 \space (1) $$

where R = $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C and PDB = Pee Dee Belemnite standard for carbon.

We used archieved soils taken at plantation establishment (1989) from the Toa Baja site as preplantation estimates of soil $\delta$$^{13}$C.
The archived soil samples were air-dried at the time of sampling, stored in plastic containers, and then analyzed concurrently with the fresh soil samples for the procedures described above.

## Soil Incubations

We conducted 4- and 8-month soil incubations to determine whether SOC$_3$ derived from N–fixing trees decomposed more rapidly than SOC$_3$ derived from *Eucalyptus*.
Surface soils (0–10-cm) from each tree plot from Kamae, Lajas, and Toa Baja were coarsely sieved (6-mm).
We incubated fresh soil samples equivalent to 15 g of oven-dried soil.
Each soil sample was brought to –0.01 MPa water potential using a pressure plate; the samples were weighed and checked twice weekly and brought back to the initial –0.01 MPa mass.
Soils were incubated at 35°C inside loosely covered 1-L glass jars, which also contained a vessel of water to maintain a high humidity environment.
The jars were opened to ambient atmosphere twice weekly to ensure adequate availability of oxygen for decomposition.

To determine relative loss of SOC$_3$, pre- and postincubation SOC concentration and $\delta$$^{13}$C values were measured for each sample, and Eqs. (2) and (3) were used to determine the %C$_3$ and mass of the pre- and postincubation SOC$_3$.
The SOC$_3$ change over time was determined by subtracting the postincubation values from the preincubation values and dividing by the preincubation values to get a relative C$_3$ loss comparison (mg C$_3$ loss/g initial C$_3$).
We analyzed for the effect of species (that is, N–fixer vs non–N–fixer) on the relative loss of SOC$_3$ using a split-plot statistical design.

## Corrections for Bulk Density

Bulk density did not differ between species for the Hawaii sites (Table 2A and B).
However, bulk density differed for soils under the pasture and forest at Lajas and over time at Toa Baja (Table 2C and D).
This means that a 0–10-cm sample taken at one place or time represented a different mass of soil at another place or time.
To correct for the bulk density differences, Lajas forest soil mass was adjusted to an equivalent pasture soil mass and Toa Baja 1996 soil masses were adjusted to 1989 equivalent masses to reflect equivalent soil mass comparisons.
Concentrations of C and N and $\delta$$^{13}$C values were all corrected for the depth adjustments.
For simplicity, depths will be addressed as 0–10, 10–20, 20–30, and 30–40 cm.
The bulk density adjustments for Lajas increased the average SOC$_T$ (kg/m$^2$) under the trees by 4%.

## Calculations

The percent of total soil organic carbon (SOC$_T$) coming from pasture grasses or sugarcane (C$_4$) was calculated as:

$$ \% C_4 = [(\delta^{13}C_{sample} - \delta^{13}C_3) / \delta^{13}C_4 - \delta^{13}C_3] \times 100 \space [@Cerri1985] \space (2) $$

where $\delta^{13}C_3$ is the $\delta^{13}$C of a composite sample of pure forest litterfall and roots and $\delta^{13}C_4$ is the $\delta^{13}$C of a composite of pure C$_4$ grass or sugarcane litter, leaves, and roots.
The C$_3$ and C$_4$ endpoints were different for each site and for each tree species within the Toa Baja and Lajas sites (Table 3).
The $\delta^{13}$C values for Hawaii are from @Bashkin1998.
Root $\delta^{13}$C values are from roots collected throughout all 0–40-cm soil cores and composited for each species.

Total SOC in kg C/m$^2$ was calculated based on the soil bulk density and C concentration for each sample depth.
The equation for SOC$_4$ (kg C/m$^2$) was:

$$ SOC_4 = (\%C_4/100) \times SOC_T \space(3)$$

Soil C derived from C$_3$ vegetation was calculated by subtracting SOC$_4$ from SOC$_T$.

We estimated the net changes in the SOC pools by using initial soil conditions at the time of planting, developed either from pre-plantation sampling (at Toa Baja) or from adjacent areas where land use remained in the prior condition of pasture or sugarcane (other sites).
We also evaluated the divergence in SOC and soil N between the N–fixers and non–N–fixers by contrasting the soils at the time of sampling.
Annual changes (kg m$^{-2}$ y$^{-1}$) in SOC$_T$, SOC$_4$, and SOC$_3$ since plantation establishment were estimated using the following equation example:

$$ SOC_3 \space change = (current \space SOC_3 - initial \space SOC_3)/plantation \space age \space (4) $$

## Separating Pre–Sugarcane/Pasture SOC$_3$ from Contemporary SOC$_3$

The SOC$_3$ pools for each site included both pre-C$_4$ and contemporary C$_3$ components.
We assumed no change in the C$_3$ components that predated the establishment of C$_4$ vegetation for two reasons.
Because disturbances to the original forest SOC$_3$ occurred several decades ago for all sites, any remaining SOC$_3$ from this period must be very recalcitrant to have remained in the soil for this long.
For the Toa Baja site, we also had archived soil samples from before the establishment of the tree and pasture plantations, and there was no discernible loss of this old SOC$_3$ in the plots that were planted with C$_4$ grasses [@Resh1999; @ReshUnpublished].
Because the Toa Baja soil is extremely sandy and would be predicted to have the highest SOC turnover rates compared with the other three sites with clay soils [@Burke1989; @Schimel1994], the Hawaii and Lajas clays also should have no measurable loss of older SOC$_3$.
Thus, we attributed any changes in SOC$_3$ (Eq. [4]) since forest plantation establishment to additions of contemporary SOC$_3$.
Furthermore, given that the pre–sugarcane/pasture SOC$_3$ turnover would be the same within any one site, SOC$_3$ comparisons between current plantation species at the site would be affected equally by the older SOC$_3$ turnover.
The resulting bias could possibly be an overprediction of the magnitude of contemporary SOC$_3$ pools and changes in those pools for the site by no more than 10% [@Schimel1994], but it would not change the relative differences between species presented in this paper.

Our estimates of the magnitude of change in the pools of organic matter derived from C$_3$ and C$_4$ sources depend in part on our expectation that the $\delta^{13}$C of organic matter from prior land use was the same as the values we used for the current C$_3$ (trees) and C$_4$ (grasses) vegetation.
We are confident that for the Hawaiian sites the historic SOC$_3$ was similar in $\delta^{13}$C to SOC derived from *Eucalyptus*, based on comparisons of native C$_3$ forests and *Eucalyptus* plantations that had no C$_4$ influence [@Bashkin1998].
In Puerto Rico, the prior soil organic matter derived from C$_3$ forests may have differed somewhat in $\delta^{13}$C from the endpoint we used, but any such difference should be minor (less than 2 per mil); it would provide small biases in our estimate SOC$_4$ and SOC$_3$ pool sizes (10%–20%); and it would not affect the test of the differing effects of tree species.

## Statistical Analysis

All analyses were conducted using SYSTAT version 7.0 (SYSTAT 1997).
For each analysis, residual plots of the raw data were inspected visually for nonnormality and heteroscedasticity violations of analysis of variance (ANOVA) assumptions.

*Species effects on SOC and N pools within site*.
We used an ANOVA for a general two-factor completely randomized block design with two to three levels of species and three to six levels of block (the number of species and block depends on site).
To test for the tree species effects on the SOC pools and soil N within a given site, we used species as the main effect with species by block interaction as the error term.
For the Puerto Rico sites with more than two tree species, we used Tukey’s multiple comparison for determination of significant differences.

*Species effects on changes in SOC pools across the four sites*.
To test for N–fixer vs non–N–fixer differences across sites, annual SOC changes were used (Eq. [4]).
For the Lajas and Toa Baja sites, where two N–fixer species were sampled, the species were averaged together into one N–fixer category to test the difference between N–fixing and non–N–fixing species.
For each site, the research plantations used a completely randomized block design.
However, combining the data into a single analysis is no longer a completely randomized block design due to the species-within-blocks restriction.
An ANOVA was used with site as the main effect, blocks as plot effects, and species-within-blocks as the split-plot effects.
With this model, site is treated as a fixed effect, and species and block are random effects.
The error terms were plot-within-site sum of squares for the main effect and species by plot-within-site sums of squares for the species effect and the site by species interaction effect [@Binkley1997].
