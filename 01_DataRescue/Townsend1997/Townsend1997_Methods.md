## Study sites

We sampled sites on the northeast flank of Mauna Kea volcano in the Laupahoehoe Forest Reserve and in the adjacent Waipunalei tract.
They consist of native *Metrosideros polymorpha* dominated rain forest (C$_3$) that ranges from 700 m to 1700 m elevation, and of pastures dominated by the African C$_4$ grass *Pennisetum clandestinum* that were converted from this forest several decades ago.
The pastures extend below the lower limit of the forest to sea level, and both forest and pasture sites are found on andisols derived from the same 12,000–20,000 year old volcanic ash deposit [@Peterson1987].

Mean annual rainfall varies from 2000 mm to 3000 mm, with a positive water balance at all elevations [@Juvik1978]; therefore the gradient is essentially one of temperature, with a decrease in mean annual temperature of about 9 °C from the lowest pasture site at 100m (MAT ~21 °C) to the highest at 1700m (MAT ~12 °C).
We selected five sites along this gradient: pastures at 100, 800, and 1700 m, and forests at 900 and 1500 m.
The uppermost two pastures are 40–50 years old, and the lowest is approximately 100 years old [@Townsend1995].

Thirty 20cm deep soil cores were collected in each of the five sites, put in a cooler, and taken back to the laboratory in Hawaii.
The roots were then removed manually, and the remaining soil was refrigerated and shipped to Stanford, CA.
Soils were either refrigerated (4 °C) or kept on ice in coolers at all times prior to the start of the incubations; the total time between sample collection and the start of the incubations was approximately ten days.

## Soil Carbon and $^{13}$C measurements

Total soil carbon was measured by passing samples through a 2mm sieve, after which the soils were oven dried at 100 °C, and kept at room temperature for analysis.
Carbon contents were determined by combustion in a Carlo-Erba C/N analyzer.

To measure soil $^{13}$C, homogenized samples of soil were combusted in a sealed quartz tube with CuO at 900 °C.
The evolved CO$_2$ was trapped and purified by breaking the tubes under vacuum, and then analyzed for $^{13}$C on a Finnigan Delta E mass spectrometer.
Results are expressed in δ$^{13}$C‰ units:

$$ δ^{13}C‰ = (^{13}R \space \text sample/ ^{13}R \space \text standard - 1) \times 1000 \space (1) $$

where $^{13}$R = $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C.
The reference was calibrated using the standard NBS19, and results are expressed vs. Pee Dee Belemnite.
All soil samples were run at the Stable Isotope Ratio Facility for Environmental Research at the University of Utah; analytical precision was ±0.1‰.

## Incubation procedure

Eight 10 g samples of soil (dry weight) per site were incubated at 20, 30, and 40 degrees C, and the CO$_2$ evolved was measured on days 5, 15, 35, 85, 135, and 225 following the start of the incubation.
For each soil sample, we drilled several holes in the bottom of a 50 ml polystyrene beaker, placed a glass fiber filter in the bottom of the beaker, and added 10 g of soil on top of the filter.
Each beaker containing soil was then stacked into a second beaker used to catch leached water.
Water was added to all soils to bring them to field capacity, and the beakers were placed in 1 qt mason jars (Figure 2).
Evolved CO$_2$ was measured by trapping it in NaOH and then titrating with HCl and BaCl [@Coleman1977]; ten blanks (jars without soil) were used to estimate any CO$_2$ not due to respiration.
Soil moisture was kept at field capacity, and soils were leached with distilled water three weeks into the incubation, and then two weeks after and before the final four sampling periods.
The lids to the mason jars were removed at regular intervals in between sampling to prevent anoxic conditions within the jars.

## δ$^{13}$CO$_2$ measurements

We carried out a second, 120 day incubation at 30 degrees C to measure changes in δ$^{13}$C of respired carbon over time.
Soils from all five sites were used, with eight 10 g samples of soil per site, and the incubation set-up was as described above.
To capture the CO$_2$ for isotopic analyses, 30 cc glass Wheaton jars were annealed, fitted with red rubber Wheaton septa that had been boiled to prevent outgassing, and then evacuated and sealed with Apiezon N grease.
The mason jar lids were fitted with Swagelok fittings connected to Teflon tubing equipped with clamps (Figure 2).
The clamps were closed, lids sealed on the jars, and CO$_2$ was allowed to accumulate (no base traps were present at this time).
A Luer-Lock syringe was then attached to the free end of the tubing, the clamp was opened, and a 30 cc sample was taken by drawing and plunging the syringe three times before locking the syringe valve.
A 22G surgical needle was then placed on the syringe and pushed through the thick portion of the Wheaton jar septum.
All of the gas was plunged into the jar, the needle removed, and the septa again sealed with grease.

CO$_2$ in the samples was purified under vacuum prior to isotopic analyses.
To separate dilute amounts of CO$_2$ from bulk air, the sample was pumped repeatedly across a series of cold traps through a closed-loop circuit.
Two needles connected the sample vial to the line.
Each needle led to opposite sides of a mercury-driven Toeppler pump with a one-way valve; this pump was used to cycle the air sample for ten minutes over two traps used to remove water and impurities, and then for an additional ten minutes over the liquid-nitrogen CO$_2$ trap.
Bulk air was then pumped out, and the CO$_2$ was transferred to a glass ampule and flame-sealed.
This procedure produced 0.1‰ accuracy in analyses of the CO$_2$ isotope standard.
All samples were analyzed on a Nuclide 6–60 mass spectrometer, and values are calibrated and reported as described above.
