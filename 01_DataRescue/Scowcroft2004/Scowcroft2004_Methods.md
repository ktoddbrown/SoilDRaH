# MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Study Sites

Our research was conducted on the northeastern (windward) slopes of Mauna Kea between 1870 and 1990 m above sea level (asl), and between coordinates 155° 19′ 56″ W long., 19° 47′ 53″ N lat. and 155° 19′ 57″ W long., 19° 51′ 13″ N lat.
The climate is cool and mesic.
Mean daily air temperature ranges from 9 to 14°C and mean daily soil temperature at 10 cm ranges from 10 to 17°C [@JeffreyUnpublished].
Rainfall averages 2000 mm yr$^{−1}$.

The volcanic-ash-derived soils in our study area were relatively young as evidenced by the presence of primary minerals, including plagioclase feldspar, augite, olivine, and ilmenite and little 1:1 or 2:1 clay [@IkawaUnpublished].
The acidic Andisols were characterized by variable charge, large amounts of soil organic C (SOC) and noncrystalline minerals, and large capacity to fix P.
Soil pH probably exceeded the point of zero variable charge (pH$_0$) and resulted in a net negative charge at all depths [@UeharaUnpublished], although the proportion of positively charged sites and anion exchange capacity likely increased as SOM decreased with depth [@Sollins1988].
Grassland soil was classified as hydrous, amorphic, isomesic Acrudoxic Hydrudand of the Piihonua series, and forest soil was classified as medial, amorphic, isomesic Typic Hydrudand of the Piha series [@SmithUnpublished].
The underlying àà lava flow of the forest was younger than that of the grassland [@Wolfe1996], but both belonged to the Laupahoehoe Volcanics Series [@Peterson1987] and surface soil to a depth of at least 30 cm was formed in the same Pahala ash deposit that covered both flows [@Stearns1946].

Grassland and planted-koa portions of our study area lay within upper reaches of Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge.
The 2000-ha grassland was the result of logging, burning, pasture development, and cattle grazing that started in the mid 1800s.
Only isolated trees and small patches of native plants in steep-sided ravines remained from the former *koa-ohia* forest.
Cattle grazing ended shortly after the refuge was created in 1985.
The unmanaged old-growth forest portion of our study area lay along the northern edge of the grassland.

Grassland vegetation consisted of perennial introduced pasture species, including, *Pennisetum clandestinum* Chiov., *Anthozanthum odoratum* L., *Holcus lanatus* L., and *Axonopus fissifolius* (Raddi) Kuhlm. *P clandestinum*, a C$_4$ grass adapted to cool, fertile sites [@Mears1970; @Wilen1996], dominated drainage bottoms, and the other grasses dominated slopes and ridges.
Grass stands were 0.5 m tall and aboveground standing biomass ranged from 7.6 Mg ha$^{−1}$ on slopes to 10 Mg ha$^{−1}$ in drainage bottoms [@Scowcroft1999].

Starting in 1987, most koa was planted in corridors that connected old remnant trees.
Corridors were three rows wide with 3- to 4-m spacing between rows and between trees within rows.
Block plantings had 2.5-m spacing.
Crown closure occurred before trees were 7 yr old.
Understory vegetation for planted koa sample sites consisted of the same grasses as found in the grassland, but shading significantly reduced their biomass [@Scowcroft1999].
A nutrient-rich fine koa litter layer accumulated beneath planted koa [@Scowcroft1999].

The open-canopy old-growth forest was dominated by native species.
Large koa and ohia trees were 15 to 20 m tall and had stem diameters at breast height >1 m.
Understory species included *Coprosma rhynchocarpa* A. Gray, *Myrsine lessertiana* A. DC, *Sophora chrysophylla* (Salisb.) Seem., *Ilex anomala* Hook. & Arnott, *Cheirodendron trigynum* (Gaud.) A. Heller, and *Dryopteris wallenchiana* (Spreng.) Hyl. *Erharta stipoides* Labill. was a common grass.
Feral pig (*Sus scrofa*) activity, which was absent in grassland and planted koa sites, was extensive and probably influenced N dynamics, although literature about pig effects on soil properties and processes was scarce and inconclusive [@Barrett1982; @Springer1984; @Moody2000].

## Experimental Design

We used a 3 by 2 factorial design with five replicates.
The three vegetation types were old-growth forest, koa planted in grassland (9–11 yr old at time of sampling), and grassland; the two topographic positions were drainage bottoms and east-to-south facing slopes (90–180° aspect).
Five sites were randomly chosen from among 15 prelocated sites per vegetation type and topographic position.
Forest sites were distributed across a 0.4-km strip of Piha Forest Reserve between 1870 to 1940 m asl, and they had to have an overstory of koa.
Those in grassland and under planted koa were distributed across a 3-km strip of the refuge between 1870 and 1990 m asl.
Grassland and planted koa sites were paired by locating them within 60 m of each other, and grassland sites were never closer than 15 m to the nearest koa tree to avoid tree roots.
This study was not replicated at similar sites in Hawaii, so findings might be different elsewhere.

## Soil Sampling and Analysis

Undisturbed core samples (AMS Extendible Split Core Sampler, 4.8 cm i.d., AMS Inc., American Falls, ID) were obtained from the top 15 cm of soil at each site to determine fine soil (<2 mm) bulk density (oven-dry basis).
Dry weight and volume of fine soil was determined by adjusting for dry weight and volume of rock fragments (measure by water displacement) caught on a 2-mm sieve.
Composite bulk samples were collected and sieved (2 mm) for determination of pH, total C, total N, and extractable P, Ca, and Mg.
Soil pH was measured in a 1:2 soil/water slurry.
Total C and N were measured with a LECO C&N 2000 Analyzer (LECO Corp., St. Joseph, MI).
Samples were combusted at 1350°C.
Mehlich-3 solution was used to extract P, Ca, and Mg [@Moody2000], and concentrations were determined with a Thermo Jarrell-Ash inductively coupled plasma spectrometer (Thermo Jarrell-Ash, Grand Junction, CO).

## Nitrogen-15 Protocols

A modification of the $^{15}$N stable isotope pool dilution method was used to measure rates of gross N transformations [@Davidson1991; @Hart1994; @Stark1996].
We used disturbed soil samples instead of intact cores because rocks in the forest soil blocked insertion of the syringe needle and prevented uniform distribution of $^{15}$N labeled solutions.
Composite bulk soil samples (*n* ≈ 3) to a depth of 15 cm were collected from each site, sieved (<2 mm), and mixed thoroughly.
Approximately 100 g of soil (o.d. equivalent) was weighed into each of six resealable plastic bags per site.
One bag of soil was used to determine initial concentrations of NH$_4^+$–N and NO$_3^−$–N.
Four bags of soil were used to determine gross NH4$^+$ and NO3$^−$ transformation rates during 2-d field incubations.
The sixth bag was used to determine net ammonification and nitrification during 20- to 30-d field incubation by the buried bag technique [@Hart1994].

We labeled NH$_4^+$ and NO$_3^−$ pools by using a syringe to dribble about one third of the amendment volume over the surface of each bagged soil sample, mixing the soil, and then repeating the process until the entire volume had been added.
Two bags of soil were each amended with 10 mL of ($^{15}$NH$_4$)$_2$SO$_4$ (99.9 atom% $^{15}$N) solution to determine gross ammonification and microbial consumption of NH$_4^+$
Two other bags of soil were each amended with 10 mL of K$^{15}$NO$_3$ (99.3 atom% $^{15}$N) solution to determine gross nitrification and microbial consumption of NO$_3^−$
Concentrations of $^{15}$N solutions varied according to expected initial sizes of native NH$_4^+$ and NO$_3^−$ pools, which were estimated from preliminary samples taken 1 to 2 wk before actual sampling.
Atom percent enrichments (APE) of NH$_4^+$ pools ranged from 46 to 57% using NH$_4^+$ solution concentrations of 80 μg $^{15}$N mL$^{−1}$ for forest bottom and planted koa soils and 40 μg $^{15}$N mL$^{−1}$ for forest slope and grassland soils.
With the exception of soil in forest drainage bottoms, APEs of NO$_3^−$ pools ranged from 40 to 76% using NO$_3^−$ solution concentrations of 80 μg $^{15}$N mL$^{−1}$ for forest soils, 10 μg $^{15}$N mL$^{−1}$ for planted koa soils on the slope, 30 μg $^{15}$N mL$^{−1}$ for planted koa soils in drainage bottoms, and 15 μg $^{15}$N mL$^{−1}$ for grassland soils.
The APE of NO$_3^−$ pools in forest drainage bottoms was only 20% due to very large NO$_3^−$ pools.
Amendments raised absolute gravimetric soil water contents by 10% to between 1.06 and 1.32 kg kg$^{−1}$

One of each pair of $^{15}$NH$_4^+$– and $^{15}$NO$_3^−$–labeled bags were sealed, returned to site, buried 10 cm below ground, and incubated about 2 d before being extracted with KCl solution.
One bag of unlabeled soil was buried on site and incubated for 20 to 30 d before being extracted.
The two other labeled bags of soil and the unlabeled bag of soil were extracted immediately—within 10 min of adding the label.
Extractions were done in the field using 15-g aliquots of soil (o.d. equivalent).
Aliquots were put into specimen cups containing 75 mL of 2 *M* KCl solution.
The cups were sealed, shaken by orbital shaker for 1 h, and shipped to Honolulu where they were vacuum filtered the next day using preleached and dried Whatman 42 paper (Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK), and the filtrates frozen until colorimetric analyses and diffusions could be done.
Ammonium concentrations were determined by the indophenol blue method @Keeney1982 and NO$_3^−$ concentrations by the Cd-reduction method [@Mulvaney1996].
Concentrations were blank corrected to adjust for contaminants on filter paper and in extracting solutions.
Thereafter, remaining extracts were diffused over 6 d onto acidified filter paper disks (Whatman 1) using the methods of [@Stark1996] Atom percent NH$_4^+$–$^{15}$N and NO$_3^−$–$^{15}$N enrichment were determined by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (ANCA-SL Stable Isotope Analysis System, Europa Scientific, Cincinnati, OH) at the Stable Isotope Laboratory, Utah State University, Logan, UT.

The $^{15}$N stable isotope pool dilution experiment was done twice.
In April 1999, we made a preliminary run to make sure field sampling and extract processing protocols were workable; only one sample site per combination of vegetation type and topographic position was used.
In October 1999, we ran the full experiment (five replicates per treatment combination).

## Calculations and Statistical Analysis

Rates of gross NH$_4^+$–N and NO$_3^−$–N transformations and net ammonification and nitrification were calculated using the equations of @Hart1994 and @Stark2000 Atom percent enrichment values for diffused samples were corrected for background and contaminant N using Eq. [2] and [3] described by @Stark1996.
The natural abundance atom% $^{15}$N was assumed to be 0.3663% in all calculations.
The *t$_0$* data for labeled and unlabeled soils were used to estimate the fraction of added $^{15}$N that was recoverable [@Hart1994; @Stark2000], and initial pool size calculations were adjusted for incomplete recovery.
Net N mineralization was defined as net ammonification plus net nitrification.
We encountered negative rates of gross NO$_3^−$ consumption, especially for drainage bottom soils under forest cover.
Others have reported negative NO$_3^−$ immobilization rates [@Verchot2001; @Wang2001; @Carmosini2002].
These negative rates were theoretically impossible and were probably due to heterogeneity between aliquots used to estimate initial NO$_3^−$ pool sizes, even though they were drawn from sieved well-mixed bulk soil samples.
Negative rates of consumption were not included in the analyses.

SAS Proc Mixed procedures (Version 8.1, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) were used to analyze treatment effects on soil properties, N-pool sizes, and rates of gross and net N transformations.
The two-parameter Box-Cox transformation [@Draper1998, p. 290] was used to equalize variance where needed.
Multiple pairwise comparisons (Tukey HSD test, α set at 0.05) were used to determine significant differences among factor level means or, where interactions were significant, among the six possible combinations of vegetation type and topographic position.
Least squares means presented in this paper were backtransformed as necessary to original units using the smearing estimator [@Duan1983].
