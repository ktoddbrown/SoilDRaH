abstract = {Land use changes, such as deforestation and reforestation, modify not only the organisms inhabiting affected areas, but also above- and belowground environments. Topography further influences local vegetation and environment. Effects of topography and re-establishment of N-fixing koa (*Acacia koa* A. Gray) trees in +100-yr-old montane grassland on surface soil properties, N pools, and N transformations were assessed using standard and {15}^N-isotope pool dilution methods. Data were collected for soils on slopes and in drainage bottoms located in grassland, under 9- to 11-yr-old planted koa, and in nearby old-growth koa-ohia (*Metrosideros polymorpha* Gaud.) forest. Soil under planted koa had significantly lower fine soil bulk density and pH than soil in grassland, and had concentrations of total C, total N, and extractable Mg and C/N ratio intermediate between grassland and forest. Topographic position affected pH and concentrations of total C, total N, and extractable P. Ten years after koa trees were re-introduced to grassland, the concentration of soil NH_4^+–N had increased above levels found even in intact forest, and the concentration of NO_3^−–N was intermediate between forest and grassland. Ammonium dominated the inorganic N pools in grassland soil and NO_3^− dominated in forest soil. Under planted koa, NH4^+ domination was beginning to give way to NO_3^− domination. Soil microorganisms were potentially strong competitors for inorganic N on grassland slopes where they immobilized nearly all the inorganic N that was produced during short- and medium-term field incubations, thus leaving little for plant growth. Re-establishment of koa trees increased soil N availability.},
