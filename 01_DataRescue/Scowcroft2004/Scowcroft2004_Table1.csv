"Table 1. Average bulk density, pH, total C and N, C/N ratio, concentrations of Mehlich-3 extractable P, Ca, and Mg, and gravimetric soil water contents in March and October 1999 for surface soil (0-15 cm) from east-facing slopes and drainage bottoms under old-growth forest, 9 to 11-yr-old *Acacia koa* planted in grassland, and grassland at 1950-m elevation in and next to Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Island of Hawaii. * Significant at the 0.05 probability level. *** Significant at the 0.001 probability level. † Fine soil bulk density (<2 mm). ‡ pH determined in 1:2 water. § Means within a column followed by the same lowercase letter are not significantly difference (Tukey HSD test, α set at 0.05); when no lowercase letters are given, values are not statistically different. ¶ Factor levels, which are denoted by uppercase letters, joined by underlines are not significantly different (Tukey HSB test, α set at 0.05). # NS = not significant.
