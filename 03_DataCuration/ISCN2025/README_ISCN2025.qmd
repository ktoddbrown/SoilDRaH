# Purpose

The purpose ISCN 2025 (aka ISCN4) is to create a data product aggregating data on geo-located soil organic carbon profiles.
With this data we will examine the assumption of steady state on field surveyed organic carbon.
We have closed contributions for this project and are working on analysis.

# Variables of interest

<!--- Briefly describe what you want the data rescuers to look for when digitizing a data resource.---->

For this analysis we are interested in:

  * **Location**: latitude/longitude, associated datum, geo-spatial method, precision
  * **Soil organic carbon stocks**: organic carbon fraction, bulk density, coarse fraction, soil organic carbon by area, soil organic carbon by volume
  * **Layer depth**: Depth of surveyed soil layer

# Data sources

For this project, we have identified the following data sources by US federal monitoring databases and direct network contributions.
These include:

+ CPEAT (@Loisel2021, @CPEAT_web)
  - This is a collection of peat cores (@PCPEAT)
  - Status: Level 0 complete. Finalizing Level 1
+ FIA
  - This is a US Forest Service database.
  - Status: Reprocessing into the new repository structure
+ NCSS
  - This is a US NRCS database.
  - Status: Reprocessing into the new repository structure
+ ISCN3 (@ISCN3)
  - This database was originally compiled in 2015, we want to update the old NCSS data.
  - Status: Reprocessing into the new repository structure



# Data Level 1 

```{r}
#Source and append all the level 1 tuples

```

# Data Level 2

```{r}
#Map the comparable methods and align any needed vocabulary
```

```{r}
#Data viz checks
```
