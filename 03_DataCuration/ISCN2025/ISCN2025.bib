@article{Loisel2021,
	abstract = {The carbon balance of peatlands is predicted to shift from a sink to a source this century. However, peatland ecosystems are still omitted from the main Earth system models that are used for future climate change projections, and they are not considered in integrated assessment models that are used in impact and mitigation studies. By using evidence synthesized from the literature and an expert elicitation, we define and quantify the leading drivers of change that have impacted peatland carbon stocks during the Holocene and predict their effect during this century and in the far future. We also identify uncertainties and knowledge gaps in the scientific community and provide insight towards better integration of peatlands into modelling frameworks. Given the importance of the contribution by peatlands to the global carbon cycle, this study shows that peatland science is a critical research area and that we still have a long way to go to fully understand the peatland--carbon--climate nexus.},

@misc{ISCN3,
	abstract = {The ISCN is an international scientific community devoted to the advancement of soil carbon research. The ISCN manages an open-access, community-driven soil carbon database. This is version 3-1 of the ISCN Database, released in December 2015. It gathers 38 separate data set contributions, totaling 67,112 sites with data from 71,198 soil profiles and 431,324 soil layers. For more information about the ISCN, its scientific community and resources, data policies and partner networks visit: http://iscn.fluxdata.org/. For information about processes used to construct the DB: https://iscn.fluxdata.org/data/data-information/.

Intellectual Rights: Data use: Use of data assumes that the user has joined the ISCN and will act according to the mission and guidelines stated in the Charter. Phase II data are available to select users on the condition that contributors will be invited to assist with interpretation, presentations, and publications, if these tasks are being performed by a user other than the original contributor of the data (such as a colleague of the contributor). When using Phase III data, users are encouraged to contact original data contributors for questions or clarifications; users agree to cite and/or acknowledge the data contributors and the ISCN in presentations and publications. References of all accepted papers developed from ISCN data products must be sent to the ISCN Coordinator. Although these policies are intended to encourage communication between data contributors and data users, the interpretation of data and adherence to fair use guidelines are ultimately the responsibility of the user of ISCN products.},
