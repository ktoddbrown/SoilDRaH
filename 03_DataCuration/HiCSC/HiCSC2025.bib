	abstract = {We studied soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in allophanic soils (Udands) along independent gradients of temperature (altitude) and land use (forest—pasture) on the island of Hawaii. Using an integrated 13C signal derived from land conversion along with measurements of soil respiration and soil carbon, we separated rapid, intermediate, and very slow turnover SOM pools, and estimated turnover times for the large intermediate pool. These estimates were compared to independent estimates using either bomb—derived soil 14C or the Century soil organic matter model. All calculations based on a three—pool SOM structure yield rates of turnover that are 3 times slower than those produced by a single pool model. Accordingly, analyses of potential feedbacks between changes in climate, atmospheric CO2, and soil carbon should incorporate the heterogeneous nature of soil organic matter. We estimate that roughly three—quarters of the carbon in the top 20 cm of these soils has turnover times less than 30 yr. Turnover times for intermediate SOM double with a 10°C change in mean annual temperature, suggesting that recalcitrant pools of SOM may be as sensitive to changes in temperature as the smaller labile pools.},

	abstract = {Agroforestry can increase the sequestration of carbon (C) in soils of tropical agroecosystems through increased litter and tree pruning inputs. Decomposition of these inputs is a key process in the formation of soil organic matter and in nutrient cycling. Our objectives were to study decay of tree pruning mulch and effects on soil C and N in a shaded coffee agroecosystem in Hawaii. Chipped tree pruning residues (mulch) were added to coffee plots shaded with the Leucaena hybrid KX2 over three years. We measured mulch decomposition and nitrogen loss over one year and changes in soil carbon and nitrogen (N) over two years. Mass loss of mulch was 80\% over one year and followed first-order decay dynamics. There was significant loss from all major biochemical components. Net N loss from the mulch was positive throughout the entire period. The C:N and lignin:N ratios of the mulch declined significantly over the decomposition period. Mulch additions significantly increased soil C and N in the top 20 cm by 10.8 and 2.12 Mg ha−1, respectively. In the no-mulch treatment, there was no significant change in soil C or N concentration, but a decline in soil bulk density led to a significant decline in total soil C. Leucaena mulch can provide an important source of organic C and N to coffee agroecosystems and can help sequester C lost as plant biomass during shade tree management.},

	abstract = {Non-native plants are invading terrestrial ecosystems across the globe, yet little is known about how invasions impact carbon (C) cycling or how these impacts will be influenced by climate change. We quantified the effect of a non-native C4 grass invasion on soil C pools and fluxes in a Hawaiian tropical dry forest over 2 years in which annual precipitation was average (Year 1) and ∼60\% higher than average (Year 2). Work was conducted in a series of forested plots where the grass understory was completely removed (removal plots) or left intact (grass plots) for 3 years before experiment initiation. We hypothesized that grass invasion would: (i) not change total soil C pools, (ii) increase the flux of C into and out of soils, and (iii) increase the sensitivity of soil C flux to variability in precipitation. In grass plots, grasses accounted for 25–34\% of litter layer C and ∼70\% of fine root C. However, no differences were observed between treatments in the size of any soil C pools. Moreover, grass-derived C constituted a negligible fraction of the large mineral soil C pool ({\textless} 3\%) despite being present in the system for ≥50 years. Tree litterfall was ∼45\% lower in grass plots, but grass-derived litterfall more than compensated for this reduction in both years. Annual cumulative soil-surface CO2 efflux (Rsoil) was ∼40\% higher in grass plots in both years, and increased in both treatments by ∼36\% in the wetter Year 2. Despite minimal grass-derived mineral soil C, {\textgreater} 75\% of Rsoil in grass plots was of C4 (i.e. grass) origin. These results demonstrate that grass invasion in forest ecosystems can increase the flux of C into and out of soils without changing total C pools, at least over the short term and as long as the native tree canopy remains intact, and that invasion-mediated changes in belowground C cycling are sensitive to precipitation.},

	abstract = {We measured soil changes through a full rotation of a Eucalyptus saligna (Sm.) plantation. We hypothesized that accretion of C from Eucalyptus trees (C3–derived carbon, C3–C) would be balanced by an equal loss of older soil C derived from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) agriculture (C4–derived C, C4–C). We also hypothesized that large additions of N-containing fertilizer would increase C accretion by increasing the rate of C addition and decreasing the rate of C loss. The low spatial variability of the soil and the intensive sampling design provided precise tests of these hypotheses. Soil C averaged 13.8 kg m−2 for the O horizon plus the 0- to 45-cm depth mineral soil, with no change through the rotation [95\% confidence interval (CI) ±0.057 kg m−2 yr−1], supporting the first hypothesis. Significant gains of C3–C (0.136 kg m−2 yr−1) balanced the losses of C4–C (0.144 kg m−2 yr−1). The second hypothesis was tested in the field using three levels of repeated, complete fertilization (including N at rates of 300, 700, and 1600 kg N ha−1), and in laboratory incubations with N addition. Addition of N had no effect on the accumulation of soil N and C3–C, nor on the rate of loss of older C4–C, refuting the second hypothesis. This first-rotation forest plantation was not able to increase soil C, even with heavy fertilization. These results contrast markedly from the soil changes under the influence of N-fixing trees, indicating that the effect of N fixation on soil C derives from factors other than N supply.},

	abstract = {Sugarcane has been widely used as a biofuel crop due to its high biological productivity, ease of conversion to ethanol, and its relatively high potential for greenhouse gas reduction and lower environmental impacts relative to other derived biofuels from traditional agronomic crops. In this investigation, we studied four sugarcane cultivars  (H-65-7052, H-78-3567, H-86-3792 and H-87-4319) grown on a Hawaiian commercial sugarcane plantation to determine their ability to store and accumulate soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) across a 24-month growth cycle on contrasting soil types. The main study objective establish baseline parameters for biofuel production life cycle analyses;  sub-objectives included (1) determining which of four main sugarcane cultivars sequestered the most soil C and (2) assessing how soil C sequestration varies among two common Hawaiian soil series (Pulehu-sandy clay loam and Molokai-clay). Soil samples were collected at 20 cm increments to depths of up to 120 cm using hand augers at the three main growth stages (tillering, grand growth, and maturity) from two experimental plots at to observe total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrates (NO−3) using laboratory flash combustion for TC and TN and solution filtering and analysis for DOC and NO−3. Aboveground plant biomass was collected and subsampled to determine lignin and C and N content. This study determined that there was an increase of TC with the advancement of growing stages in the studied four sugarcane cultivars at both soil types (increase in TC of 15–35 kg·m2). Nitrogen accumulation was more variable, and NO−3 ({\textless}5 ppm) were insignificant. The C and N accumulation varies in the whole profile based on the ability of the sugarcane cultivar’s roots to explore and grow in the different soil types. For the purpose of storing C in the soil, cultivar H-65-7052 (TC accumulation of {\textasciitilde}30 kg·m−2) and H-86-3792 (25 kg·m−2) rather H-78-3567 (15 kg·m−2) and H-87-4319 (20 kg·m−2) appeared to produce more accumulated carbon in both soil types.},

	abstract = {Plant litter decomposition is a critical step in the formation of soil organic matter, the mineralization of organic nutrients, and the carbon balance in terrestrial ecosystems. Biotic decomposition in mesic ecosystems is generally negatively correlated with the concentration of lignin, a group of complex aromatic polymers present in plant cell walls that is recalcitrant to enzymatic degradation and serves as a structural barrier impeding microbial access to labile carbon compounds. Although photochemical mineralization of carbon has recently been shown to be important in semiarid ecosystems, litter chemistry controls on photodegradative losses are not understood. We evaluated the importance of litter chemistry on photodegradation of grass litter and cellulose substrates with varying levels of lignin [cellulose-lignin (CL) substrates] under field conditions. Using wavelength-specific light attenuation filters, we found that light-driven mass loss was promoted by both UV and visible radiation. The spectral dependence of photodegradation correlated with the absorption spectrum of lignin but not of cellulose. Field incubations demonstrated that increasing lignin concentration reduced biotic decomposition, as expected, but linearly increased photodegradation. In addition, lignin content in CL substrates consistently decreased in photodegradative incubations. We conclude that lignin has a dual role affecting litter decomposition, depending on the dominant driver (biotic or abiotic) controlling carbon turnover. Under photodegradative conditions, lignin is preferentially degraded because it acts as an effective light-absorbing compound over a wide range of wavelengths. This mechanistic understanding of the role of lignin in plant litter decomposition will allow for more accurate predictions of carbon dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {We tested the Walker and Syers (1976) conceptual model of soil development and its ecological implications by analyzing changes in soil P, vegetation, and other ecosystem properties on a soil chronosequence with six sites ranging in age from 300 yr to 4.1 x 106 yr. Climate, dominant vegetation, slope, and parent material of all of the sites were similar. As fractions of total P, the various pools of soil phosphorus behaved very much as predicted by Walker and Syers. HCI—extractable P (presumably primary mineral phosphates) comprised 82\% of total P at the 300—yr—old site, and then decreased to 1\% at the 20,000—yr—old site. Organic phosphorus increased from the youngest site to a maximum at the 150 000 yr site, and then declined to the 4.1 x 106 yr site. Occluded (residual) P increased steadily with soil age. In contrast to the Walker and Syers model, we found the highest total P at the 150 000—yr—old site, rather than at the onset of soil development, and we found that the non—occluded, inorganic P fraction persisted through to the oldest chronosequence site. Total soil N and C increased substantially from early to middle soil development in parallel with organic P, and then declined through to the oldest site. Readily available soil P, NH4+, and NO3— were measured using anion and cation exchange resin bags. P availability increased and decreased unimodally across the chronosequence. NH4+ and NO3— pools increased through early soil development, but did not systematically decline late in soil development. In situ decomposition rates of Metrosideros polymorpha litter were highest at two intermediate—aged sites with soil fertility (20 000 yr and 150 000 yr), and lowest at the less—fertile beginning (300 yr) and endpoint (4.1 x 106 yr) of the chronosequence. M. polymorpha leaves collected from these same four sites, and decomposed in a common site, suggested that leaves from intermediate—aged sites were inherently more decomposable than those from the youngest and oldest sites. Both litter tissue quality and the soil environment appeared to influence rates of decomposition directly. The highest mean soil N2O emissions (809 mg°m—2°d—1) were measured at the 20 000—yr—old site, which also had the highest soil nitrogen fertility status. Plant communities at all six chronosequence sites were dominated primarily by M. Polymorpha, and to a lesser extent by several other genera of trees and shrubs. There were, however, differences in overall vegetation community composition among the sites. Using a detrended correspondence analysis (DECORANA), we found that a high proportion of species variance among the sites (eigenvalue = 0.71) can be explained by site age and thus soil developmental stage. Overall, long—term soil development across the chronosequence largely coincides with the conceptual model of Walker and Syers (1976). How P is distributed among different organic and inorganic fractions at a given stage of soil development provides a useful context of evaluating contemporary cycling of P and other nutrients, and for determining how changes in P availability might affect diverse ecosystem processes.},

This study evaluates the relative effects of soil type and land use on (i) soil microbial community structure and (ii) the contribution of SOM derived from the original forest vegetation to the functioning of pasture and sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) ecosystems. We used principal components analysis (PCA) of soil phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles to evaluate microbial community structure and PLFA stable carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) as indicators of the δ13C of microbial substrates. Soil type mainly determined the relative proportions of Gram positive versus Gram negative bacteria whereas land use primarily determined the relative proportion of fungi, protozoa, and actinomycetes versus other types of microorganisms. Comparison of a simple model to our PLFA δ13C data from land use chronosequences indicates that forest-derived SOM is actively cycled for appreciably longer times in sugarcane ecosystems developed on Andisols (mean turnover time = 50 yr) than in sugarcane ecosystems developed on an Oxisol (mean turnonver time = 13 yr). Our analyses indicate that soil chronosequence PLFA δ13C measurements can be useful indicators of the contribution that SOM derived from the original vegetation makes to continued ecosystem function under the new land use.},

We measured indicators of forest productivity and soil and leaf nutrients across independent gradients of precipitation and elevation/temperature in lower montane Hawaiian forests dominated by a single overstorey species, Acacia koa, situated on 1500–3000-y-old soils that were mixtures of volcanic ash and basalt. Stand basal area was highest at the wettest site, 2000 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP), and leaf N and P were lowest at the driest site, 1000 mm MAP. Soil N availability and leaf N concentration declined across an 850-m elevation gradient, but this was not correlated with stand basal area or soil organic matter content. Across all stands, basal area was negatively correlated with the exchangeable soil P fraction. As well, the soil C:N ratio was negatively correlated with both soil P availability and the size of the primary mineral P fraction. Soil P availability and weathering appear to be important determinants of soil organic matter quantity and quality. Overall, precipitation is the major driving force for forest productivity, but P weathering and availability play important roles in limiting productivity in wetter sites and in controlling soil organic matter dynamics in these N-fixing forests.},

Along a gradient of decreasing rainfall with elevation, on Histosols, F. uhdei had decreased stand basal area, productivity, and canopy development. At high-elevation sites, productivity of F. uhdei was limited by N, and F. uhdei benefitted from association with A. koa, as (i) foliar N content of F. uhdei was positively related to aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), (ii) leaf area index, biomass increment, and ANPP of F. uhdei increased in a single-species stand after N additions, but there was no response by either F. uhdei or A. koa in a mixed stand, and (iii) productivity of F. uhdei in mixed stands with A. koa at high-elevation sites was greater than in single-species stands, and F. uhdei foliage was enriched with N in proportion to the fraction of stand basal area in A. koa. Seemingly, growth of F. uhdei on Histosols was also limited by water availability, as an index of carbon isotope composition of leaves (δ13C), and, therefore, intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUE) increased with elevation. Biomass production of F. uhdei stands per unit leaf area and per unit intercepted radiation (ε) decreased with increasing elevation on Histosols. Decreased nitrogen-use efficiency and ε of F. uhdei on Histosols were both traded off against increased WUE.},

	abstract = {Intensively managed plantations of trees occupy vast areas of the tropics. The productivity of these forests depends strongly on nutrient supply, and nutrient supply may change rapidly under intensive management regimes. We documented changes in a Hawaiian soil after 32 mo of development of a plantation of eucalyptus [Eucalyptus saligna (Sm.)]. Soil C did not change significantly (average = -23 g C m-2 yr-1 to 30 cm; 95\% confidence −139 to +93 g C m-2 yr-1). This lack of change in soil C resulted from a rapid loss of older soil C derived from sugarcane (−191 g C m-2 yr-1) and a rapid gain of new soil C from eucalyptus (160 g C m-2 yr-1). Soil N declined by 19 g N m-2 yr-1 (P = 0.08), despite fertilizer additions of 31 to 70 g m-2. Large reductions in exchangeable Ca and Mg probably resulted from dissolution and leaching of residual lime from prior agricultural management. We conclude that intensive sampling regimes may detect relatively small changes in tropical forest soils, and that expectations of C accumulation in soils following afforestation may need to be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {The effects of forest-to-pasture conversion on soil carbon (C) stocks depend on a combination of climatic and management factors, but factors that relate to grazing intensity are perhaps the least understood. To understand the long-term impact of grazing in converted pastures, methods are needed that accurately measure the impact of grazing on recent plant inputs to soil C in a variety of pasture management and climate settings. Here, we present an analysis from Hawai'i of changes in vegetation structure and soil organic carbon (SOC) along gradients of grazing intensity and elevation in pastures converted from dry tropical forest 100 years ago. We used hyperspectral remote sensing of photosynthetic vegetation, nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and exposed substrate to understand the effects of grazing on plant litter cover, thus, estimating recent plant inputs to soils (the NPV component). Forest-to-pasture conversion caused a shift from C3 to C4 plant physiology, thus the δ13C method was used in soil cores to measure the fraction of SOC accumulated from pasture vegetation sources following land conversion. SOC decreased in pasture by 5–9 kg C m−2, depending upon grazing intensity. SOC derived from C3 (forest) sources was constant across the grazing gradient, indicating that the observed variation in SOC was attributable to changes in C inputs following deforestation. Soil C stocks were also reduced in pastures relative to forest soils. We found that long-term grazing lowers SOC following Hawaiian forest-to-pasture conversion, and that these changes are larger in magnitude that those occurring with elevation (climate). Further we demonstrate a relationship between remotely sensed measurements of surface litter and field SOC measurements, allowing for regional analysis of pasture condition and C storage where limited field data are available.},

	abstract = {Soils retain large quantities of carbon, thereby slowing its return to the atmosphere. The mechanisms governing organic carbon sequestration in soil remain poorly understood, yet are integral to understanding soil-climate feedbacks. We evaluated the biochemistry of dissolved and solid organic carbon in potential source and sink horizons across a chronosequence of volcanic soils in Hawai'i. The soils are derived from similar basaltic parent material on gently sloping volcanic shield surfaces, support the same vegetation assemblage, and yet exhibit strong shifts in soil mineralogy and soil carbon content as a function of volcanic substrate age. Solid-state13carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicate that the most persistent mineral-bound carbon is comprised of partially oxidized aromatic compounds with strong chemical resemblance to dissolved organic matter derived from plant litter. A molecular mixing model indicates that protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and char content decreased whereas oxidized lignin and carboxyl/carbonyl content increased with increasing short-range order mineral content. When solutions rich in dissolved organic matter were passed through Bw-horizon mineral cores, aromatic compounds were preferentially sorbed with the greatest retention occurring in horizons containing the greatest amount of short-range ordered minerals. These minerals are reactive metastable nanocrystals that are most common in volcanic soils, but exist in smaller amounts in nearly all major soil classes. Our results indicate that long-term carbon storage in short-range ordered minerals occurs via chemical retention with dissolved aromatic acids derived from plant litter and carried along preferential flow-paths to deeper B horizons.},

	abstract = {Deforestation is one of the main reasons for the global net release of CO2 from soil to atmosphere. Estimates of CO2 emission from soils are highly variable, mainly due to limited data of C dynamics in soils after forest clearing. The objective of this study was to calculate the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) storage after deforestation in three soil types in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica with help of the δ13C method. Changes in bulk density, which normally accompany land use changes, had a profound influence on the results of the calculations. Deforestation, followed by 25 yr of pasture, caused a net loss of 21.8 Mg ha−1 in SOC for an Eutric Hapludand and 1.5 Mg ha−1 for an Oxic Humitropept. The SOC changes in time were studied on a deforestation sequence on an Andic Humitropept. In the first years after forest clearing, decomposition of tree roots caused an extra input of SOC, which influenced the δ13C signal. Decomposition of forest C and increase of pasture C were mathematically described for several depths. A considerable influence of depth on decomposition rates was found. The strong stabilization of organic C by Al-organic matter complexes probably caused the relatively small net C loss from SOC since forest clearing.},

Sets of 12 surfacesoil samples were gathered in three positions: bare soils; under the crowncanopy of adjacent live plants; and below dead, withered rosettes. Silverswordstanding litter and live foliage were also collected. Several physical andchemical properties were investigated. Bare soils were coarse and exceptionallylow in chemical nutrients and water-holding capacity. Litter addition belowsilverswords altered all properties except particle-size distribution; soilsunder dead rosettes became modified more strongly than those below live plants.While rosettes grow, standing litter is tightly preserved, thus only smallamounts of organic matter are added to soil. When plants die, a substantialinflux of litter is released in a short period (7 to 9 years average); thisraises the C and N content, C/N ratios, exchangeable nutrient levels (Ca, Mg,K, P) and cation exchange capacity of soil. Physical properties, such as color,bulk density and porosity are also greatly affected; as a result, soilwater-retention at field capacity nearly doubles under withering plants. Soiltemperatures (5 cm depth) at noon were ∼18.1 °C lower beneath silversword canopies(18.5 °C mean) than in contiguous bare soils(36.6 °C). This cooling may result in lower evaporationand further conservation of soil moisture, thus increased seedgermination. Nutrient-retention strategies may have evolved in the semelparousArgyroxiphium to help it cope with the harsh,drought-prone soils and unpredictable climate of Haleakala. Silverswordflowering results in a tremendous seed output, but the plant needs to ensurethat some seeds – which have limited dispersal capability – willgerminate, and thus provides a nutrient-rich, water-retaining substrate moresuitable for seedling establishment than bare soils. Through itsself-regulating influence on underlying soils,Argyroxiphium affects both soil formation and its ownregeneration in Haleakala.},

All of the sites were at the same elevation and of the same substrate age; all were native-dominated forests containing Metrosiderospolymorpha Gaud. Soil concentrations of extractable NO3-N and PO4-P, as well as major cations (Ca, Mg, and K), decreased with increasing annual precipitation, and δ15N values became more depleted in both soils and vegetation. For M.polymorpha leaves, leaf mass per area (LMA) and lignin concentrations increased significantly, while δ13C values became more depleted with increasing precipitation.  Foliar phosphorus, and major cation (Ca, Mg, and K) concentrations for M.polymorpha all decreased significantly with increasing precipitation. For other native forest species, patterns of LMA, δ13C, and δ15N generally mirrored the pattern observed for M.polymorpha. Decreasing concentrations of available rock-derived nutrients in soil suggest that the effect of increased rainfall on leaching outweighs the effect of increasing precipitation on weathering.  The pattern of decreased foliar nutrient concentrations per unit leaf area and of increased lignin indicates a shift from relatively high nutrient availability to relatively high carbon gain by producers as annual precipitation increases. For nitrogen cycling, the pattern of higher inorganic soil nitrogen concentrations in the drier sites, together with the progressively depleted δ15N signature in both soils and vegetation, suggests that nitrogen cycling is more open at the drier sites, with smaller losses relative to turnover as annual precipitation increases.},

The live tissues of Dicranopteris had greater lignin content whereas Cheirodendron had a greater lipid, N-bearing, and polysaccharide component. Despite this difference in leaf chemistry, SOM chemistry was similar between soil aggregate fractions, but different between horizons. The O-horizon contained primarily lignin and polysaccharide biomarkers whereas the A-horizon contained polysaccharide, aromatic, and N-derived compounds, indicating considerable microbial processing of plant litter. The soils beneath Cheirodendron inherited a greater lipid signal composed of cutin and suberin biomarkers whereas the soils beneath Dicranopteris contained greater aromatic biomarker content, possibly derived from plant lignins. The soils beneath both species were more similar to root polysaccharides, lipids, and lignins than aboveground tissue. This study indicates that although plant-derived OM is processed vigorously, species-specific biomarkers and compound class differences persist into these soils and that differences in plant chemical properties may influence soil development even after considerable reworking of plant litter by microorganisms.},

Relatively few studies, however, have examined the dynamics of soil C pools after conversion of farmland to forest or pasture. We selected three pairs of secondary forests and pastures that originated from the same abandoned sugarcane (interspecific hybrids of Saccharum spp.) land in the wet tropics of Hawaii to examine whether forest or pasture converted from farmland is more effective in sequestering C in soils. We compared the soil C pool, soil chemistry, and stable C isotope ratios between the forests and pastures. We found that total soil C was greater (P {\textless} 0.01) in forests than in the pastures 22 years after land conversion. The percentages of SOC4 in the pastures were significantly higher than in the secondary forests in both soil layers. The percentages of SOC3 in the pastures were lower than in the secondary forests in both soil layers. The net SOC3 increase in the forest soils at 0–10 and 10–25 cm was 28.6 ± 5.6 and 43.9 ± 3.2 Mg ha−1 while net SOC4 increase in pasture soils at these respective depths was 18.8 ± 2.2 and 26.1 ± 2.7 Mg ha−1. We found that the net increases of SOC3 in both soil layers in the forest were greater (P {\textless} 0.01) than the net increases of SOC4 in the respective soil layers in the pasture. Aluminum saturation was greater (P {\textless} 0.01) in the forests than the pastures in both soil layers. There was no difference in oxalate extractable Fe concentration between the forests and the pastures but oxalate extractable Al concentration in both soil layers was greater (P {\textless} 0.05) in forests than the pastures.

	abstract = {Exotic plant invasions into Hawaiian montane forests have altered many important nutrient cycling processes and pools. Across different ecosystems, researchers are uncovering the mechanisms involved in how invasive plants impact the soil microbial community—the primary mediator of soil nutrient cycling. We examined whether the invasive plant, Hedychium gardnerianum, altered microbial community composition in forests dominated by a native tree, Metrosideros polymorpha, under varying soil nutrient limitations and soil fertility properties within forest plots of the Hawaii long-term substrate age gradient (LSAG). Microbial community lipid analysis revealed that when nutrient limitation (as determined by aboveground net primary production [ANPP]) and soil fertility were taken into account, plant species differentially altered soil microbial community composition. Microbial community characteristics differed under invasive and native plants primarily when N or P was added to the older, highly weathered, P-limited soils. Long-term fertilization with N or P at the P-limited site led to a significant increase in the relative abundance of the saprophytic fungal indicator (18:2ω6c,9c) under the invasive plant. In the younger, N-limited soils, plant species played a minor role in influencing soil microbial community composition. We found that the general rhizosphere microbial community structure was determined more by soil fertility than by plant species. This study indicates that although the aggressive invasion of a nutrient-demanding, rapidly decomposable, and invasive plant into Hawaiian forests had large impacts on soil microbial decomposers, relatively little impact occurred on the overall soil microbial community structure. Instead, soil nutrient conditions were more important determinants of the overall microbial community structure within Hawaii’s montane forests.},

Soil under planted koa had significantly lower fine soil bulk density and pH than soil in grassland, and had concentrations of total C, total N, and extractable Mg and C/N ratio intermediate between grassland and forest. Topographic position affected pH and concentrations of total C, total N, and extractable P. Ten years after koa trees were re-introduced to grassland, the concentration of soil NH4+–N had increased above levels found even in intact forest, and the concentration of NO3−–N was intermediate between forest and grassland. Ammonium dominated the inorganic N pools in grassland soil and NO3− dominated in forest soil. Under planted koa, NH4+ domination was beginning to give way to NO3− domination. Soil microorganisms were potentially strong competitors for inorganic N on grassland slopes where they immobilized nearly all the inorganic N that was produced during short- and medium-term field incubations, thus leaving little for plant growth. Re-establishment of koa trees increased soil N availability.},

CO2fluxes early in the incubations decreased rapidly, and then stabilizedat approximately 20\% of initial values for sevenmonths. We suggest that the rapid drop and subsequent stabilizationof respiration reflects a change in the dominant source of theCO2 from labile (active) to much more recalcitrantpools of soil organic matter (SOM). Estimates of active SOM weremade by integrating all of the carbon respired in excess of thatattributable to respiration of the intermediate SOM pool; thesevalues ranged from 0.7–4.3\% of total soil C.δ13C values for carbon respired from the pasturesoils showed that older, forest-derived C contributed an increasingfraction of total soil respiration with time. Initial and late-stagerespiration responded similarly to changes in temperature, suggestingthat intermediate SOM is as sensitive to temperature as the activefraction.},

	abstract = {Amendment of agricultural soils with biochar may sequester atmospheric carbon (C), affect soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and change crop yields; the resulting impact to agroecosystems’ net global warming potential (GWP), economic feasibility, and overall sustainability is highly relevant to tropical agriculture in Hawai‘i. To examine the use of biochar in Hawai‘i, field trials were studied for joint assessment of GWP and economic performance. A highly fertile Mollisol and an infertile Oxisol were amended with biochar and cultivated with no-till management of bioenergy feedstock (napier grass, var. bana) and conventional tillage of a food crop (sweet corn, Hawaiian Supersweet \#9). Measurement of GWP included GHG emissions and C dynamics of crop biomass, soil, and biochar. Economic assessment combined traditional benefit-cost analysis (BCA) with full- cost accounting to include environmental costs of GWP, using net present value (NPV) as a metric for sustainability. The resulting hybrid BCA was tested under alternative scenarios wherein key variables were altered. Lastly, the relative importance of these variables in determining NPV was quantified using sensitivity analysis. Biochar amendment decreased soil GHG emissions in the Mollisol, but increased emissions in the Oxisol; concurrently, biochar increased napier grass yields by 14\%, yet decreased sweet corn yields by 6\%. These combined effects decreased GWP and increased NPV by as much as 73\% in napier grass, resulting in a sustainable biochar system. In sweet corn, however, the best-case biochar scenario still decreased NPV by 31\%—no matter how highly C was valued, corn yield decreases could not be outweighed by GWP improvements. In all, the most important factor was how biochar affected crop yields (ß=12.90±0.86), followed by GWP value (ß=10.01±1.12) and biochar investment cost (ß=7.88±0.01). For the average Hawaiian farmer, this means that investment in biochar should be carefully considered, despite its burgeoning popularity. This study showed that the best prospect for biochar amendment is for minimum-tillage crops, such as perennial bioenergy feedstocks, grown in naturally fertile soils.},

	abstract = {Rangelands are a land use type found extensively throughout both the globe and the Hawaiian Islands. These lands provide ecosystem services such as soil carbon sequestration, which can aid in slowing climate change, enhance soil physical and chemical qualities, and potentially provide diversified income for farmers. However, questions remain regarding the extent of sequestered carbon in rangeland soils, as well as the mechanisms controlling the variability of these stocks, especially in Hawaii. The majority of rangelands in Hawaii are situated on Andisols, a soil order known for high soil carbon content due to in part to unique mineralogy. Therefore, my dissertation research sought to intensively sample representative Hawaiian rangelands to identify baseline soil carbon stock, determine a minimum sampling density required for accurate estimates of landscape-scale variability, compare methods of spatial analysis, and to identify environmental factors that affect soil carbon stock distribution. Further, selective dissolution of mineral components of rangeland soils were carried out to relate mineralogy to soil carbon concentration. Finally, I investigated different methods of vegetation management in a silvopastoral production system in a replicated field trial to discern the effect of practice on soil carbon and sward characteristics.High levels of soil carbon stock were found throughout actively grazed rangeland, indicating the importance of these soils in contributing to the regulation of Earth’s climate. Carbon stocks and concentrations varied with environmental as well as mineralogical factors, presenting valuable potential co-variables for consideration in future sampling collections. Integration of livestock in koa (Acacia koa) production systems achieved some understory vegetation management goals, but did not significantly change in soil carbon concentration after one year, highlighting the requirement of long-term studies for soil carbon research. After baseline carbon characteristics are determined, repeated, long-term sampling will be required from different rangeland production systems to identify the effect of management on soil carbon resources. These land use types are important in providing food and ecosystem services to the human population, and a more complete understanding and quantification of their baseline soil qualities, as well as the factors driving those characteristics, will aid in future management decisions that seek to maximize both agricultural productivity and ecosystem health.},

	abstract = {Volcanic ash soils retain the largest and most persistent soil carbon pools of any ecosystem. However, the mechanisms governing soil carbon accumulation and weathering during initial phases of ecosystem development are not well understood. We examined soil organic matter dynamics and soil development across a high-altitude (3,560–3,030 m) 20-kyr climate gradient on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Four elevation sites were selected ( 250–500 mm rainfall), which range from sparsely vegetated to sites that contain a mix of shrubs and grasses. At each site, two or three pits were dug and major diagnostic horizons down to bedrock (intact lava) were sampled. Soils were analyzed for particle size, organic C and N, soil pH, exchangeable cations, base saturation, NaF pH, phosphorous sorption, and major elements. Mass loss and pedogenic metal accumulation (hydroxlamine Fe, Al, and Si extractions) were used to measure extent of weathering, leaching, changes in soil mineralogy and carbon accumulation. Reactive-phase (SRO) minerals show a general trend of increasing abundance with increasing rainfall. However carbon accumulation patterns across the climate gradient are largely decoupled from these trends. The results suggest that after 20 kyr, pedogenic processes have altered the nature and composition of the volcanic ash such that it is capable of retaining soil C even where organic acid influences from plant material and leaching from rainfall are severely limited. Carbon storage comparisons with lower-elevation soils on Mauna Kea and other moist mesic (2,500 mm rainfall) sites on Hawaii suggest that these soils have reached only between 1\% and 15\% of their capacity to retain carbon. Our results suggest that, after 20 kyr in low rainfall and a cold climate, weathering was decoupled from soil carbon accumulation patterns and the associated influence of vegetation on soil development. Overall, we conclude that the rate of carbon supply to the subsoil (driven by coupling of rainfall above ground plant production) is a governing factor of forms and amount of soil organic matter accumulation, while soil mineralogy remained relatively uniform.},

	abstract = {The Hawaiian Islands are the only high land in a vast stretch of the North Pacific where past climatological and ecological processes can be reconstructed from terrestrial Earth system archives. We measured hydroclimatic proxies and carbon accumulation in an organic sediment core from the windward montane peatland Pēpē‘ōpae on the Island of Moloka‘i, Hawai‘i using radiocarbon, leaf wax geochemistry, and stable isotopes of carbon and hydrogen in addition to historical pollen records. Following a period of soil development, substantial carbon accumulation began around 10 ka BP (thousands of years before present) under wet conditions. Peat formation was continuous but variable throughout the Holocene, including maxima in carbon accumulation around 9 and 3 ka and a minimum around 1.5 ka that has resulted in a belowground carbon storage today of 144 kg C m-2. From this core we generated a new chronology for previously published pollen spectra from the study site and a Wetness Index that shows increases in dry-adapted taxa in upwind forests during periods of decreased carbon accumulation in the peatland. Shifts in the distribution of sedimentary n-alkane chain lengths in the context of 14 species of modern bog plant n-alkanes suggests litter inputs have been derived from a diverse plant community that changed in dominant species in response to climate. Hydrogen stable isotope ratios of sedimentary C29n-alkanes show negative departures around 9 and 3 ka consistent with increases in storm-derived rainfall likely related to the position and strength of the northern jet stream. This study is the first to provide a continuous organic sedimentary record of links between hydroclimate, vegetation, and montane belowground carbon sequestration for this part of the North Pacific.},

We measured energycane yields, root biomass, soil C pools, and soil C stocks in a 4 year field trial and modeled C flow from plants to soils in the surface layer of no-till energycane planted after more than a century of intensive sugarcane agriculture. Aboveground yields ranged from 16.7 to 19.0 Mg C/ha over the 4 year trial. Although total C stocks did not significantly differ in the surface layer (approx. 0–20 cm) during the study, C in free and occluded light fractions decreased, whereas C in the mineral-rich dense fraction increased over 4 years. Belowground system inputs, estimated from measurements and informed by convergence in the final soil fraction model, were set to 2.5 Mg C ha−1 year−1. With this input value, we estimated that surface soils retained photosynthetically fixed C predominantly within the mineral-associated organic matter pool for a mean and median transit time of 177 and 110 years, respectively. Although we did not model C flow to deep soil layers (approx. 0–100 cm), observed C accumulation (11.4 Mg C ha−1 year−1) and root growth down to 120 cm suggest that soil processes and resulting C sequestration at the surface are likely to persist deeper into the soil profile. Energycane, as a strong candidate for climate change mitigation and land degradation remediation, showed high biomass yields and allocation of resources to roots, with sequestered soil C expected to persist for over a century.},

	abstract = {Mitigation of climate change via increased plant productivity and soil carbon (C) sequestration during land use change can be a powerful driver of the net greenhouse gas emissions of a sustainable production system. Yet the net climate change mitigation of managed forests is affected by both tradeoffs between C sequestration and non-renewable C emissions and assessment methodology. As a case study, we measured ecosystem stocks to determine the potential C implications of converting pasture to managed eucalyptus forest and compared them with the eucalyptus production system's non-renewable C emissions. The forest border was chosen as the system boundary and operations spanned from forest establishment activities to harvested wood placed at the forest perimeter. Eucalyptus biomass C was 57.2 ± 4.2 Mg C ha?1 and soil C stock (to ?1 m depth) was approximately an order of magnitude greater. By the prevalent method for bulk density-based determination of C stock, conversion of pasture to eucalyptus forest significantly increased soil C stock by 17.5 ± 8.0\%. However, no significant change was detected by the equivalent soil mass method, a less prevalent but more accurate approach to detecting differences in soil C stock due to land use or management changes. A 7-year eucalyptus production cycle generated 1.0 Mg C ha?1 in non-renewable emissions, which was far exceeded by the tree biomass C. Thus, even without significant soil C sequestration, this system provided a substantial climate change mitigation service by offsetting non-renewable energy use and C emissions associated with wood production, and providing opportunities for biofuel and bioenergy products to displace fossil fuel products.},
