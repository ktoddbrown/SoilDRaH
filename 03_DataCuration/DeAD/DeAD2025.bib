abstract = {Plant litter decomposition is a critical step in the formation of soil organic matter, the mineralization of organic nutrients, and the carbon balance in terrestrial ecosystems. Biotic decomposition in mesic ecosystems is generally negatively correlated with the concentration of lignin, a group of complex aromatic polymers present in plant cell walls that is recalcitrant to enzymatic degradation and serves as a structural barrier impeding microbial access to labile carbon compounds. Although photochemical mineralization of carbon has recently been shown to be important in semiarid ecosystems, litter chemistry controls on photodegradative losses are not understood. We evaluated the importance of litter chemistry on photodegradation of grass litter and cellulose substrates with varying levels of lignin [cellulose-lignin (CL) substrates] under field conditions. Using wavelength-specific light attenuation filters, we found that light-driven mass loss was promoted by both UV and visible radiation. The spectral dependence of photodegradation correlated with the absorption spectrum of lignin but not of cellulose. Field incubations demonstrated that increasing lignin concentration reduced biotic decomposition, as expected, but linearly increased photodegradation. In addition, lignin content in CL substrates consistently decreased in photodegradative incubations. We conclude that lignin has a dual role affecting litter decomposition, depending on the dominant driver (biotic or abiotic) controlling carbon turnover. Under photodegradative conditions, lignin is preferentially degraded because it acts as an effective light-absorbing compound over a wide range of wavelengths. This mechanistic understanding of the role of lignin in plant litter decomposition will allow for more accurate predictions of carbon dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems.}}

  abstract  = "Summary Litter in arid and semi‐arid ecosystems usually exhibits
               a prolonged standing dead phase after senescence; however, we
               know little about the ways in which abiotic and microbial
               processes affect standing litter decomposition. We conducted a
               26‐month in situ decomposition experiment in a steppe to
               investigate the potential mechanisms governing the decomposition
               of standing litter, and a 192‐day laboratory incubation
               experiment to further explore the impacts of the standing dead
               stage on the subsequent litter decomposition and soil organic
               carbon (SOC) formation after the litter falls to the soil
               surface. Compared with soil surface litter, standing litter has
               higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content. Standing litter
               also experienced higher night‐time relative humidity on its
               surface, which enhanced litter moisture content. The higher DOC
               concentration, combined with the greater night‐time moisture
               content, stimulated more microbial activity in standing litter.
               The decomposition rate (k) of standing litter was 92\% higher
               than that of soil surface litter. Moreover, the standing phase
               conditioned the litter, leading to more rapid decomposition
               after the litter fell to the soil surface, and increasing the
               efficiency with which the litter formed SOC. We conclude that
               the long‐neglected standing phase greatly determines litter
               decomposition and soil carbon storage in semi‐arid regions.
               Accounting for standing litter decomposition is critical for
               accurately simulating carbon turnover in arid and semi‐arid
               ecosystems. A lay summary is available for this article.",

 abstract = {We conducted studies of mass losses from surface and buried litter bags in four North American hot desert areas to test the following hypotheses: (1) leaf litter disappearance in hot deserts is independent of actual evapotranspiration, (2) buried litter disappearance is a function of actual evapotransporation, (3) the pattern of microarthropod colonization of buried leaf litter is a function of the stage of decomposition, and (4) elimination of microarthropods results in reduced rates of decomposition and increased numbers of free-living nematodes. Mass losses from surface Larrea tridentata leaf litter bags ranked highest to lowest: Chihuahuan desert, Sonoran desert, Mojave desert, Coloradan desert. Mass losses from buried litter bags were essentially equal. @?40%, in each of the deserts for bags buried from March to October. There was low correlation between rainfall and mass loss of buried litter and surface litter in the North American hot deserts. Mass losses from insecticide-treated buried bags were lower than from untreated bags. There was a greater abundance of nematodes in insecticide-treated bags than in untreated bags. Tarsonemid mites were found only in litter bags from the Chihuahuan desert. The most abundant microarthropods in buried leaf litter in the other deserts were predatory raphignathids, tydeids, and arctacarids. Decomposition (litter disappearance) in North American hot deserts was highly correlated with long-term rainfall patterns, which we hypothesize have served as the selective agents for the soil biota active in the decomposition process. Thus litter disappearance does not respond to annual fluctuations in rainfall amounts.},

abstract = {Predicting rates by which dead plant material breaks down is essential for global carbon models. Dryland ecosystems are critical to the global carbon cycle, as they cover \&gt;40\% of the terrestrial area, but modeled predictions of dryland litter decomposition frequently do not match measurements. We suggest that extreme spatial heterogeneity in drylands has been insufficiently addressed in models and measurements. Spatial heterogeneity in microsites, largely the result of patchy vegetation, causes high variability in microclimate and uneven distribution of litter pools. We synthesize existing data on decomposition rates among microsites and illustrate how failure to consider microsite heterogeneity can affect landscape-level decomposition estimates. Inclusion of data from a diverse range of microsites should greatly improve representation of dryland decomposition models. Our understanding of carbon and nutrient dynamics in globally vast and socioeconomically critical dryland ecosystems lags behind mesic systems. Litter decomposition models consistently underestimate measured decomposition in these regions. Both models and measurements largely represent spatially dominant intercanopy areas; however, little litter resides in these interspaces as transport vectors move litter to other microsites such as beneath plant canopies and buried in soil. Abiotic and biotic conditions differ among microsites, but few studies have characterized microsite impacts on decomposition. We collated data on microsites where litter accumulates. In microsites with sufficient available data, we used meta-analysis to test hypotheses on decomposition relative to litter in intercanopy spaces. Decomposition was lower under woody plant canopies than in intercanopy spaces. Buried litter decomposed faster than surface litter. There was no difference in decomposition between surface litter and litter suspended aboveground to simulate standing dead. All microsite contrasts had exceptions, suggesting that site-specific characteristics influence microclimate and subsequent decomposition. Extrapolation of decomposition rates to the landscape-level (using estimates of microsite-specific decomposition rates multiplied by litter pools), suggests that decomposition estimates based on intercanopy data alone underrepresent landscape-level decomposition. Thus, despite advances in the understanding of mechanistic decomposition drivers in drylands advancing, most studies are spatially unrepresentative analyses in intercanopy areas and this will underestimate decomposition at the landscape level. Expanding the ecological relevance of decomposition processes to be useful for predicting larger-scale carbon and nutrient dynamics requires improved characterization of dryland litter distribution, coupled with a mechanistic understanding of decomposition in microsites where litter accumulates.}}
