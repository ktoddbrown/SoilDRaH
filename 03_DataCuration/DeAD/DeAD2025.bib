abstract = {Plant litter decomposition is a critical step in the formation of soil organic matter, the mineralization of organic nutrients, and the carbon balance in terrestrial ecosystems. Biotic decomposition in mesic ecosystems is generally negatively correlated with the concentration of lignin, a group of complex aromatic polymers present in plant cell walls that is recalcitrant to enzymatic degradation and serves as a structural barrier impeding microbial access to labile carbon compounds. Although photochemical mineralization of carbon has recently been shown to be important in semiarid ecosystems, litter chemistry controls on photodegradative losses are not understood. We evaluated the importance of litter chemistry on photodegradation of grass litter and cellulose substrates with varying levels of lignin [cellulose-lignin (CL) substrates] under field conditions. Using wavelength-specific light attenuation filters, we found that light-driven mass loss was promoted by both UV and visible radiation. The spectral dependence of photodegradation correlated with the absorption spectrum of lignin but not of cellulose. Field incubations demonstrated that increasing lignin concentration reduced biotic decomposition, as expected, but linearly increased photodegradation. In addition, lignin content in CL substrates consistently decreased in photodegradative incubations. We conclude that lignin has a dual role affecting litter decomposition, depending on the dominant driver (biotic or abiotic) controlling carbon turnover. Under photodegradative conditions, lignin is preferentially degraded because it acts as an effective light-absorbing compound over a wide range of wavelengths. This mechanistic understanding of the role of lignin in plant litter decomposition will allow for more accurate predictions of carbon dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems.}}

               a prolonged standing dead phase after senescence; however, we
               know little about the ways in which abiotic and microbial
               processes affect standing litter decomposition. We conducted a
               26‐month in situ decomposition experiment in a steppe to
               investigate the potential mechanisms governing the decomposition
               of standing litter, and a 192‐day laboratory incubation
               experiment to further explore the impacts of the standing dead
               stage on the subsequent litter decomposition and soil organic
               carbon (SOC) formation after the litter falls to the soil
               surface. Compared with soil surface litter, standing litter has
               higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content. Standing litter
               also experienced higher night‐time relative humidity on its
               surface, which enhanced litter moisture content. The higher DOC
               concentration, combined with the greater night‐time moisture
               content, stimulated more microbial activity in standing litter.
               The decomposition rate (k) of standing litter was 92\% higher
               than that of soil surface litter. Moreover, the standing phase
               conditioned the litter, leading to more rapid decomposition
               after the litter fell to the soil surface, and increasing the
               efficiency with which the litter formed SOC. We conclude that
               the long‐neglected standing phase greatly determines litter
               decomposition and soil carbon storage in semi‐arid regions.
               Accounting for standing litter decomposition is critical for
               accurately simulating carbon turnover in arid and semi‐arid

 abstract = {We conducted studies of mass losses from surface and buried litter bags in four North American hot desert areas to test the following hypotheses: (1) leaf litter disappearance in hot deserts is independent of actual evapotranspiration, (2) buried litter disappearance is a function of actual evapotransporation, (3) the pattern of microarthropod colonization of buried leaf litter is a function of the stage of decomposition, and (4) elimination of microarthropods results in reduced rates of decomposition and increased numbers of free-living nematodes. Mass losses from surface Larrea tridentata leaf litter bags ranked highest to lowest: Chihuahuan desert, Sonoran desert, Mojave desert, Coloradan desert. Mass losses from buried litter bags were essentially equal. @?40%, in each of the deserts for bags buried from March to October. There was low correlation between rainfall and mass loss of buried litter and surface litter in the North American hot deserts. Mass losses from insecticide-treated buried bags were lower than from untreated bags. There was a greater abundance of nematodes in insecticide-treated bags than in untreated bags. Tarsonemid mites were found only in litter bags from the Chihuahuan desert. The most abundant microarthropods in buried leaf litter in the other deserts were predatory raphignathids, tydeids, and arctacarids. Decomposition (litter disappearance) in North American hot deserts was highly correlated with long-term rainfall patterns, which we hypothesize have served as the selective agents for the soil biota active in the decomposition process. Thus litter disappearance does not respond to annual fluctuations in rainfall amounts.},

abstract = {Predicting rates by which dead plant material breaks down is essential for global carbon models. Dryland ecosystems are critical to the global carbon cycle, as they cover \&gt;40\% of the terrestrial area, but modeled predictions of dryland litter decomposition frequently do not match measurements. We suggest that extreme spatial heterogeneity in drylands has been insufficiently addressed in models and measurements. Spatial heterogeneity in microsites, largely the result of patchy vegetation, causes high variability in microclimate and uneven distribution of litter pools. We synthesize existing data on decomposition rates among microsites and illustrate how failure to consider microsite heterogeneity can affect landscape-level decomposition estimates. Inclusion of data from a diverse range of microsites should greatly improve representation of dryland decomposition models. Our understanding of carbon and nutrient dynamics in globally vast and socioeconomically critical dryland ecosystems lags behind mesic systems. Litter decomposition models consistently underestimate measured decomposition in these regions. Both models and measurements largely represent spatially dominant intercanopy areas; however, little litter resides in these interspaces as transport vectors move litter to other microsites such as beneath plant canopies and buried in soil. Abiotic and biotic conditions differ among microsites, but few studies have characterized microsite impacts on decomposition. We collated data on microsites where litter accumulates. In microsites with sufficient available data, we used meta-analysis to test hypotheses on decomposition relative to litter in intercanopy spaces. Decomposition was lower under woody plant canopies than in intercanopy spaces. Buried litter decomposed faster than surface litter. There was no difference in decomposition between surface litter and litter suspended aboveground to simulate standing dead. All microsite contrasts had exceptions, suggesting that site-specific characteristics influence microclimate and subsequent decomposition. Extrapolation of decomposition rates to the landscape-level (using estimates of microsite-specific decomposition rates multiplied by litter pools), suggests that decomposition estimates based on intercanopy data alone underrepresent landscape-level decomposition. Thus, despite advances in the understanding of mechanistic decomposition drivers in drylands advancing, most studies are spatially unrepresentative analyses in intercanopy areas and this will underestimate decomposition at the landscape level. Expanding the ecological relevance of decomposition processes to be useful for predicting larger-scale carbon and nutrient dynamics requires improved characterization of dryland litter distribution, coupled with a mechanistic understanding of decomposition in microsites where litter accumulates.}}

abstract = {Changes in mass and chemical composition of Pinus sylvestris senescent needles were studied over a 5 year period in Mediterranean (MF) and Continental forests (CF) in the Pyrenees under varying levels of thinning (P0: reference, no thinning; P20: removal of 20% basal area, P30: removal of 30% basal area). Decomposition rates were higher in MF (k = 0.423 year−1) than in CF (k = 0.245 year−1). However, the maximum decomposition limit was higher in MF (87.9%) compared to CF (78.1%). The relative importance and timing of rainfall, and cellulose and lignin abundance on the decomposition process was similar among both sites. However, air temperature and degree-days only affected CF (the colder site) during the initial stages of decomposition, while litter moisture was significant only in MF (the drier site) in the latter stages of decomposition. Nutrient and carbon dynamics showed temporal patterns similar to those reported in higher latitudes (except for Ca), however, indicators of N mineralization such as C/N and lignin/N at the study sites were lower than values reported in the literature. Decreases in decomposition rates after thinning were higher in MF than in CF, indicating that this ecosystem could, in the short term, be more sensitive to human intervention. Thinning had similar temporary qualitative effects at both sites, slowing decomposition, increasing N and P immobilization and decreasing Ca immobilization. However, quantitative effects of thinning were site dependent in that the magnitude of nutrient immobilization was higher in CF. A conceptual model is presented to explain effects of thinning on litter N dynamics. These temporary changes are not trivial as nutrient immobilization and accumulated organic matter losses over a thinning cycle may affect tree growth particularly during short rotations and intensive fast-growing plantations. Under similar nutrient availability conditions, sites where nutrient release occurs faster may show higher post-thinning tree growth rates.}

abstract = {This study reports changes in the plant's chemical composition and the decomposition of this plant material under enhanced solar UV-B radiation. Calamagrostis epigeios, a dominant grass species in the dune grassland in The Netherlands, was grown outdoor on an experimental field under ambient and enhanced solar UV-B (5 and 7.5 kJ m-2 day-1 UV-BBE, respectively), corresponding to about 15% stratospheric ozone depletion. After one growing season aerial plant parts were harvested. The decomposition of this harvested leaf material was studied in a dune grassland and on the above mentioned experimental field under ambient (5 kJ m-2 day-1 UV-BBE) and enhanced (7.5 kJ m-2 day-1 UV-BBE) radiation, using litter bags. The chemical quality of the leaves grown under enhanced solar UV-B changed. There was an increase in the leaf content of lignin, while no significant changes occurred for the content of α-cellulose, hemicellulose and tannins under enhanced UV-B. In the field, the rate of decomposition of leaf material grown under enhanced UV-B (with an increased content of lignin) was reduced. The content of lignin of the decomposing leaf material increased, but less under exposure to enhanced UV-B. The latter may be explained by photodegradation of the lignin. The consequences of enhanced UV-B radiation for carbon fluxes in the dune grassland ecosystem are discussed.}

abstract = {Our knowledge about the influence of silvicultural treatments on nutrient cycling processes in Mediterranean forests is still limited. Four levels of tree removal were compared in an Aleppo pine forest in eastern Spain to determine the effects on litterfall, litter decomposition and the associated nutrient fluxes after 12 years. Removal treatments included clearfelling, two shelterwood intensities (60 and 75 % of basal area removed) and untreated controls. Twelve years later, the basal area removed still explained 60 % of litterfall mass variance and 60 % of C, 52 % of N, 45 % of P, 17 % of K, 47 % of Ca and 60 % of Mg return variances. Litter decomposed somewhat more slowly in clearfellings compared to controls (p = 0.049), accumulated more Ca and released less K compared to the other three treatments. This was explained by contamination with mineral particles due to the poorly developed O horizon in clearfellings. We conclude that the management practices reduced the nutrient return via litterfall, but the nutrient release through decomposition seems poorly sensitive to canopy disturbance. In order to accurately quantify the harvesting impacts on nutrient cycling in this Mediterranean forest system, it is necessary to measure the litterfall of the understory layer.}

abstract = {One of the more uncertain aspects of nutrient cycling in desert ecosystems is the extent to which decomposition is controlled by water availability. Some of this uncertainty may be partly related to the duration of the studies and/or differences in the chemical composition of the decaying litter. We conducted a 3-year field study of rainfall to determine the impact of summer (June – September) drought on decomposition of leaf and root litter of two shrub species (Larrea tridentata and Prosopis glandulosa) in the northern Chihuahuan Desert (New Mexico, U.S.A.). In both species, leaf litter decayed at a faster rate and was less effected by drought than root litter. Drought had no influence on the rates of decomposition of leaves of either species during the first 18 months, but caused decay rates to decline by about 25% during the latter half of the study. Drought decreased decay of root litter in both species by about 25% throughout the 3 years. There was a general increase in percent nitrogen (%N) of decomposing leaf litter in both species. Root litter %N declined slightly in Larrea but remained relatively constant in Prosopis. Using a modified version of the CENTURY model, we were able to predict most aspects of observed leaf and root litter mass loss and nitrogen dynamics. Overall, the results of this study suggest that relatively large changes in precipitation produce comparatively small changes in rates of decay of both leaf and root litter.}

abstract = {Grasslands of the Edwards Plateau of central Texas have been extensively altered through woody species encroachment, particularly as a result of increasing abundance of the invasive native shrub, Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei). Over the last several decades there has been widespread mechanical removal of the species. The wood is often left in place to decompose, either mulched or not. Where the wood is left to decompose might have some bearing on its rate of decomposition. This study was conducted to determine the rates of Ashe juniper wood decomposition as a function of open vs. shaded habitat and the potential effect of wood decomposition on nutrient inputs into this system. Wood decomposition in this arid ecosystem might be expected to occur more rapidly in shaded habitat where the moisture and temperature regimes would be more favorable for wood-decomposing fungi. On the other hand, during times of low rainfall we might expect wood to decompose more rapidly when exposed to high levels of ultraviolet radiation. In our experiment, we found no difference between open and shaded treatments. Wood biomass loss occurred rapidly over the first 3–4 mo of the study and slowed for the remaining 2 yr. Wood carbon (C) increased only slightly (7.3%), but nitrogen (N) increased significantly (176%). As a consequence of changes in wood nitrogen, C∶N decreased through time. Results of this study suggest that the wood decomposition process in open and shaded habitats in this arid ecosystem during a time of low rainfall do not differ. Our findings also suggest that land managers aiming to establish native species following felling of Ashe juniper should do so in the first year when nutrient release from decomposing wood is the highest.}

However, it is unclear if this is a result of direct UV-B effects on saprobic microorganisms, or a result of UV-B-induced changes in litter quality that indirectly affect decay by saprobes. In this study, we evaluated the magnitude of direct and indirect effects on litter decomposition of Brassica napus by soil fungi, under growth chamber conditions. We found that, both, direct and indirect UV-B negatively influenced litter decomposition, however, direct effects were much more pronounced. We then tested whether UV-B radiation would have species-specific effects on fungal colonization and competitive ability, rather than influencing all fungal species equally. We predicted that darkly pigmented fungi would increase their relative competitive ability under high UV-B. The test fungi were all isolated from field soil under Brassica napus. Two fungi were hyaline (Aspergillus terreus, Trichoderma koningii), two were darkly-pigmented (Cladosporium sphaerospermum, Epicoccum purpurascens) and one had a hyaline mycelium but darkly-pigmented conidia (Aspergillus niger). Elevated UV-B radiation had differential direct and indirect effects on fungal growth, and caused shifts in the competitive balances between pigmented and non-pigmented fungi. However, in only two of six pair-wise challenges did the pigmented species increase their relative competitive ability under UV-B conditions. It is clear that UV-B profoundly influence fungal community structure in soil, but the direction of such effects remains unpredictable.}

abstract = {Litter production in many drought-affected ecosystems coincides with the beginning of an extended season of no or limited rainfall. Because of lack of moisture litter decomposition during such periods has been largely ignored so far, despite potential importance for the overall decay process in such ecosystems. To determine drivers and extent of litter decay in rainless periods, a litterbag study was conducted in Mediterranean shrublands, dwarf shrublands and grasslands. Heterogeneous local and common straw litter was left to decompose in open and shaded patches of various field sites in two study regions. Fresh local litter lost 4–18% of its initial mass over about 4 months without rainfall, which amounted to 15–50% of total annual decomposition. Lab incubations and changes in chemical composition suggested that litter was degraded by microbial activity, enabled by absorption of water vapor from the atmosphere. High mean relative humidity of 85% was measured during 8–9 h of most nights, but the possibility of fog deposition or dew formation at the soil surface was excluded. Over 95% of the variation in mass loss and changes in litter nitrogen were explained by characteristics of water-vapor uptake by litter. Photodegradation induced by the intense solar radiation was an additional mechanism of litter decomposition as indicated by lignin dynamics. Lignin loss from litter increased with exposure to ultraviolet radiation and with initial lignin concentration, together explaining 90%–97% of the variation in lignin mass change. Our results indicate that water vapor, solar radiation and litter quality controlled decomposition and changes in litter chemistry during rainless seasons. Many regions worldwide experience transient periods without rainfall, and more land area is expected to undergo reductions in rainfall as a consequence of climate change. Therefore, absorption of water vapor might play a role in decomposition and nutrient cycling in an increasing number of ecosystems.}

The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of forest thinning on the early-stage foliar decomposition rate and nutrient immobilization-release pattern in a mixed Quercus pyrenaica-Pinus pinaster forest growing in the western Mediterranean basin. Two thinning treatments, differing in the intensity of canopy reduction, were compared with a control (unthinned) situation. Oak leaves showed faster decomposition rates than pine needles in unthinned plots. Intense canopy reduction (40% of basal area removed) reduced decomposition rates in both species whereas intermediate reduction (25% of basal area removed) increased decomposition of needles to a rate similar to that of oak leaves. C and N transfer from N-rich to N-poor foliar litter was not detected, indicating a marginal role of canopy reduction in this process. A decoupling of the decomposition rate from immobilization-release pattern was found for mobile elements (K and Mg) at intermediate levels of canopy cover whereas Ca dynamics indicated that pine needles had not started the lignin-mediated degradation phase two years after incubation. We finally hypothesized that strong reductions of canopy cover in dry Mediterranean sites might have an aridification effect on litter decomposition.}

abstract = {We assessed whether exposure to solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) affects the mass loss of Larrea tridentata (creosotebush) litter in the Sonoran Desert of central Arizona. We placed three types of litter (leaves, twigs, or a natural mixture of leaves, twigs, and seeds) in bags constructed of UV-B-transmitting or UV-B-absorbing filter material that allowed either 85% (near-ambient UV-B treatment) or 15% (reduced UV-B treatment) of the biologically effective solar UV-B to reach litter inside the bags. Bags were placed outdoors for 4–5 months during the winter at two sites: a balcony or on the soil surface of the desert. Mass loss of leaf litter was greater under near-ambient UV-B than reduced UV-B at both sites: 21 (near-ambient) vs. 18% (reduced) on the balcony, and 18 vs. 14% at the desert site. Mass loss of twig litter was also greater under near-ambient UV-B at the desert site. Mass loss of the natural mixture of litter was also greater when exposed to near-ambient UV-B on the balcony, and tended to be greater at the desert site. We estimate that about 14–22% of the total mass loss of leaf litter during our 4–5 month experiments was attributable to solar UV-B exposure. Leaf litter exposed to near-ambient UV-B had lower concentrations of lignin, and fats and lipids, and slightly higher concentrations of holocellulose. The greater mass loss of litter under near-ambient UV-B appeared mainly attributable to loss of lignin, although losses of fats and lipids were also appreciable. A primary reason for greater mass loss of litter under solar UV-B appeared to be photodegradation, particularly of lignin.}

abstract = {Differences in litter quality, microbial activity or abiotic conditions cannot fully account for the variability in decomposition rates observed in semiarid ecosystems. Here we tested the role of variation in litter quality, water supply, and UV radiation as drivers of litter decomposition in arid lands. And show that carry-over effects of litter photodegradation during dry periods can regulate decomposition during subsequent wet periods. We present data from a two-phase experiment, where we first exposed litter from a drought-deciduous and an evergreen shrub to natural UV levels during five, rainless summer months and, subsequently, in the laboratory, we assessed the carry-over effects of photodegradation on biomass loss under different irrigation treatments representing the observed range of local rainfall variation among years (15–240 mm). Photodegradation of litter in the field produced average carbon losses of 12%, but deciduous Proustia pungens lost >25%, while evergreen Porlieria chilensis less than 5%. Natural exposure to UV significantly reduced carbon-to-nitrogen and lignin:N ratios in Proustia litter but not in Porlieria. During the subsequent wet phase, remaining litter biomass was lower in Proustia than in Porlieria. Indeed UV exposure increased litter decomposition of Proustia under low and medium rainfall treatments, whereas no carry-over effects were detected under high rainfall treatment. Consequently, for deciduous Proustia carry-over effects of UV exposure were negligible under high irrigation. Litter decomposition of the evergreen Porlieria depended solely on levels of rainfall that promote microbial decomposers. Our two-phase experiment revealed that both the carry-over effects of photodegradation and litter quality, modulated by inter-annual variability in rainfall, can explain the marked differences in decomposition rates and the frequent decoupling between rainfall and litter decomposition observed in semiarid ecosystems.}

Mass and nutrient content of litter fall and forest floor differed greatly among species and generally decreased in the order: F. silvatica>A. borisii regis>P. nigra>P. pinaster. Mean annual litter fall ranged from 4000 kg/ha at the beech site to 1420 kg/ha at the maritime pine site and forest floor dry weight varied from a high of about 82 t/ha under the fir site to a low of 32 t/ha under the maritime pine site. The accretion of nutrients (kg/ha per year) on the forest floor through litterfall ranged from 6.9 to 32.8 for N, 0.7 to 2.8 for P, 3.2 to 12.3 for K, 3.7 to 47.9 for Ca, 1.8 to 8.6 for Mg and from 0.25 to 0.80 for Na. Average element quantities (kg/ha·per year) of the forest floor were between 235.4 and 913.9 for N, 15.4 and 55.8 for P, 40.4 and 113.1 for K, 99.3 and 506.9 for Ca, 39.9 and 285.5 for Mg, and between 3.1 and 18.2 for Na. Site quality did not considerably affect either the litter fall and nutrient returns to the forest floor or the littermass and nutrient accumulation in the L horizon. A positive relationship, however, was noticed between site quality and litter and nutrient accumulation in the F, H horizons beneath the black pine and beech and a negative one beneath the fir. Residence times of forest floor were approximately 17 years at the beech site, 21 years at the black pine site, 23 years at the maritime pine site and 32 years at the fir site suggesting considerable differences in the decomposition rate among forest sites which were mainly associated to the litter fall, the microclimate conditions and the nutrient status of the sites. Further, residence time of litter mass and nutrients were substantially greater in the current study than in other studies carried out in Mediterranean type conditions indicating, slower decomposition rates in Greek forests.}

As a part of this project, the litter carbon dynamics were investigated at three Acacia aneura forest sites, using a litter carbon model incorporating the physical removal of litter by winds, floods, etc. Based on the field observation data of above ground plant biomass, annual litter fall, existing amount of the litter, and also litter decomposition rate constants separately obtained for leaf litter and woody litter, we investigated the carbon flows at these forest sites, especially the annual amount of litter physically removed from the sites by floods or winds. As a result, it is estimated that annual physical removal of litter amounted to 59–75% of the annual litter fall, and the litter removal rate constants were from 0.38 to 0.55 year−1. Roughly one third to a half of the existing litter is removed annually from the sites. There was also a tendency that as the canopy coverage decreases, the litter removal rate constant increases. For this type of ecosystem, which is susceptible to the run-off of water and strong winds, we consider the taking into account of the physical removal of the litter is essential for analyzing the carbon dynamics in the ecosystem.}

abstract = {The arid and semi-arid drylands of the world are increasingly recognized for their role in the terrestrial net carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake, which depends largely on plant litter decomposition and the subsequent release of CO2 back to the atmosphere. Observed decomposition rates in drylands are higher than predictions by biogeochemical models, which are traditionally based on microbial (biotic) degradation enabled by precipitation as the main mechanism of litter decomposition. Consequently, recent research in drylands has focused on abiotic mechanisms, mainly photochemical and thermal degradation, but they only partly explain litter decomposition under dry conditions, suggesting the operation of an additional mechanism. Here we show that in the absence of precipitation, absorption of dew and water vapor by litter in the field enables microbial degradation at night. By experimentally manipulating solar irradiance and nighttime air humidity, we estimated that most of the litter CO2 efflux and decay occurring in the dry season was due to nighttime microbial degradation, with considerable additional contributions from photochemical and thermal degradation during the daytime. In a complementary study, at three sites across the Mediterranean Basin, litter CO2 efflux was largely explained by litter moisture driving microbial degradation and ultraviolet radiation driving photodegradation. We further observed mutual enhancement of microbial activity and photodegradation at a daily scale. Identifying the interplay of decay mechanisms enhances our understanding of carbon turnover in drylands, which should improve the predictions of the long-term trend of global carbon sequestration.}

Microbial communities, major conductors of organic matter decomposition are also subject to these environmental constraints. In this study, our aim was to understand how microbial activities vary at a small spatio-temporal scale in a Mediterranean coastal environment. Microbial activities were monitored in a Pinus halepensis litter collected from two areas, one close to (10 m) and one far from (300 m) the French Mediterranean coast. Litters were transferred from one area to the other using litterbags and studied via different microbial indicators after 2, 5 and 13 months. Microbial Basal Respiration, qCO2, certain enzyme activities (laccase, cellulase, β-glucosidase and acid phosphatase) and functional diversity via Biolog microplates were assayed in litterbags left in the area of origin as well as in litterbags transferred from one area to the other. Results highlight that microbial activities differ significantly in this short spatial scale over time. The influence of microlocal conditions more intensified for litters situated close to the sea, especially during summer seems to have a stressful effect on microbial communities, leading to less efficient functional activities. However, microbial activities were more strongly influenced by temporal variations linked to seasonality than by location.}

In arid ecosystems, plant litter cycling exceeds rates predicted based on precipitation amounts, suggesting that additional factors are involved. Attempts to reveal these factors have focused on abiotic degradation, soil–litter mixing and alternative moisture sources. Our aim was to explore an additional hypothesis that macro-detritivores control litter cycling in deserts. We quantified the role different organisms play in clearing plant detritus from the desert surface, using litter baskets with different mesh sizes that allow selective entry of micro-, meso- or macrofauna. We also measured soil nutrient concentrations in increasing distances from the burrows of a highly abundant macro-detritivore, the desert isopod Hemilepistus reaumuri. Macro-detritivores controlled the clearing of plant litter in our field site. The highest rates of litter removal were measured during the hot and dry summer when isopod activity peaks and microbial activity is minimal. We also found substantial enrichment of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorous near isopod burrows. We conclude that burrowing macro-detritivores are important regulators of litter cycling in this arid ecosystem, providing a plausible general mechanism that explains the unexpectedly high rates of plant litter cycling in deserts.}

Herbaceous succession following juniper cutting or prescribed fire has been well documented, however, impacts of these disturbances to litter and nutrient cycling is limited in these invasive semi-arid woodlands. This study evaluated the effects of cutting juniper trees on leaf litter decomposition and nitrogen (N) dynamics over a 2-year period in eastern Oregon, USA. Litter bags were used to measure juniper leaf litter decomposition and track litter carbon (C) and N fluxes in cut and uncut juniper woodland treatments. Litter mass loss was 37% greater in the cut treatment compared to the uncut treatment after 2 years. Greater litter inputs, higher litter fall quality, and micro-environmental differences were suggested to have been the main causes for the higher litter decomposition rate in the cut treatment. In both treatments, litter N was released by the second year of decomposition, though N release was greater in the uncut treatment. Retention of juniper debris on site permits storage and release of nutrients through decomposition processes which is likely important in maintaining site productivity.}

For this, monthly collections of litter material were carried out, both in areas under restoration process and in the reference ecosystem. As a result, litter-fall rates were lower at areas undergoing ecological restoration than in the reference ecosystem. However, leaf fraction deposition rates were higher in areas undergoing ecological restoration. The decomposition rates did not show significant differences between the study areas, however there were differences regarding temporal variations, being more accelerated during the dry season, in all areas.}

However, how the UV radiation affects the litter decomposition on the forest floor remains unclear. Here, we conducted a field-based experiment in 2011 in the southeastern Horqin Sandy Land, Northeast China, to investigate the effects of UV radiation, litter layer thickness, and their interaction on the mass loss and chemical properties of decomposing litter from Xiaozhuan poplar (Populus × xiaozhuanica) and Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) plantation trees. We found that UV radiation accelerated the decomposition rates of both the Xiaozhuan poplar litter and Mongolian pine litter. For both species, the thick-layered litter had a lower mass loss than the thin-layered litter. The interaction between UV radiation and litter layer thickness significantly affected the litter mass loss of both tree species. However, the effects of UV radiation on the chemical properties of decomposing litter differed between the two species, which may be attributed to the contrasting initial leaf litter chemical properties and morphology. UV radiation mostly had positive effects on the lignin concentration and lignin/N ratio of Xiaozhuan poplar litter, while it had negative effects on the N concentration of Mongolian pine litter. Moreover, litter layer thickness and its interaction with UV radiation showed mostly positive effects on the N concentration and lignin/N ratio of Xiaozhuan poplar litter and the ratios of C/N and lignin/N of Mongolian pine litter, and mostly negative effects on the C/N ratio of Xiaozhuan poplar litter and the N concentration of Mongolian pine litter. Together, these results reveal the important roles played by UV radiation and litter layer thickness in the process of litter decomposition in this semi-arid region, and highlight how changes in the litter layer thickness can exert strong influences on the photodegradation of litter in tree plantations.}

Previous relationships between decomposition rates and abiotic variables like temperature and moisture have been proved confounding, particularly for dryland ecosystems. Decomposition rates of two grass species, Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) Á. Löve and Calamagrostis rubescens Buckley, which represent dominant understory cover at either end of a semi-arid grassland to forest ecocline near Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada, were measured. Despite differences in %N and C:N, decomposition rates between the two species were similar. Elevation was strongly correlated with rate of decomposition for both species. We provide evidence of a positive correlation of water availability and a negative correlation of temperature on decomposition rates along the elevational ecocline. Decomposition rates were higher during the wetter spring period than during summer, at higher elevations and in more mesic ecosystems. We found no ‘home-field’ advantage for P. spicata and C. rubescens on decomposition rates. Our results provide evidence that available moisture is an important control on decomposition rates in dryland ecosystems.}

abstract = {Photodegradation due to litter exposure to solar UV radiation (UV) is presumed to contribute to the surprisingly fast decomposition in some arid and semi-arid regions; however, precipitation may affect the relative importance of photodegradation versus microbial decomposition in litter decomposition. To assess the dependence of photodegradation effects on precipitation, we subjected litters from three plant life forms (spring annual, summer annual and shrub) to two UV treatments (UV block and sunlight) combining four precipitation treatments (two frequencies plus two amounts) over 2.5 years. UV radiation increased k, and it interacted with litter type, with the strongest stimulating effects on low lignin content litter. Precipitation amount and frequency both affected k, and UV photodegradation was dependent on precipitation, with the strongest photodegradation effects in low frequency and low amount of precipitation. UV radiation decreased microbial PLFAs, and altered microbial community in two litters by depressing fungi development. High precipitation frequency significantly increased microbial PLFAs in E. oxyrrhynchum litter. Litter decomposition rate was negatively correlated with initial lignin concentration, and UV photodegradation effects increased with increasing lignin loss, suggesting that the increased decomposition rate under UV radiation may primarily result from photochemical mineralization of lignin, rather than from facilitation of microbial decomposition. Our results demonstrate that UV radiation plays an important role in desert litter decomposition. The dependence of photodegradation on litter type and precipitation underscores the importance of incorporating UV radiation-induced C release into modeling of C cycling in desert ecosystems.}

abstract = {Solar radiation plays an important role in carbon cycling by increasing the decomposition rates of plant litter and soil organic matter (i.e. photodegradation). Previous work suggests that exposure to radiation can facilitate microbial decomposition of litter by altering litter chemistry and consequently litter degradability (i.e. photopriming). However, it remains unclear to what extent photopriming contributes to litter decomposition processes and on what timescale photopriming operates. We conducted laboratory experiments to compare the effects of UV photopriming at two temporal scales (months versus days). In one experiment, we found that four months of UV exposure induced a significant but small (3–4%) mass loss in two of three litter species commonly found in California oak savanna; however, UV exposure did not alter litter degradability as measured by microbial respiration in an incubation experiment. We also found that UV exposure had limited effects on lignin and other cell wall structures, but one month of microbial decomposition (in absence of UV exposure) significantly reduced lignin β-aryl ether inter-unit linkages and acetylated xylans. These results indicate that abiotic photodegradation alone was ineffective at breaking down lignin. In another experiment, litter of a common grass was exposed to either alternating UV radiation and dark conditions or constant darkness for 128 days. We found that the alternating UV exposure increased litter CO2 production in both dark and UV phases over that observed in constant darkness. This led to a 35% greater release of CO2 from the alternating UV exposure treatment between days 65 and 128 of the experiment. These results demonstrate that alternating UV exposure with dark conditions is key to enabling photopriming on a timescale of days. Overall, we identify short-term photopriming as a novel mechanism behind photodegradation. Our results also challenge the conventional hypothesis that abiotic processes are primarily responsible for degrading lignin during photodegradation.}

In this study, we used a microcosm experiment to examine the effects of two understory species (Artemisia scoparia and Setaria viridis) litter on the mass loss and N release of Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) litter in Keerqin Sandy Lands, northeast China, and identified the influencing mechanism from the chemical quality of decomposing litter. Four litter combinations were set up: one monoculture of Mongolian pine and three mixtures of Mongolian pine and one or two understory species in equal mass proportions of each species. Total C, total N, lignin, cellulose and polyphenol concentrations, and mass loss of pine litter were analyzed at days 84 and 182 of incubation. The chemistry of pine litter not only changed with the stages of decomposition, but was also strongly influenced by the presence of understory species during decomposition. Both understory species promoted mass loss of pine litter at 84 days, while only the simultaneous presence of two understory species promoted mass loss of pine litter at 182 days. Mass loss of pine litter was negatively correlated with initial ratios of C/N, lignin/N and polyphenol/N of litter combinations during the entire incubation period; at 182 days it was negatively correlated with polyphenol concentration and ratios of C/N and polyphenol/N of litter combinations at 84 days of incubation. Nitrogen release of pine litter was promoted in the presence of understory species. Nitrogen release at 84 days was negatively correlated with initial N concentration; at 182 days it was negatively correlated with initial polyphenol concentration of litter combinations and positively correlated with lignin concentration of litter combinations at 84 days of incubation. Our results suggest that the presence of understory species causes substantial changes in chemical components of pine litter that can exert strong influences on subsequent decomposition of pine litter.}

Willd.) and catclaw (Mimosa biuncifera Benth.), N2-fixing trees or shrubs, dominate the landscape. It is unknown, however, how much the leaves of those shrubs contribute to dynamics of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil. We investigated this by adding leaves of each species to soil sampled under the canopy of mesquite, huisache, and catclaw and outside their canopy while monitoring production of carbon dioxide (CO2), and dynamics of inorganic N (ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3−)) in an aerobic incubation. The (hemi)cellulose and N content of the catclaw leaves was lower and the lignin and polyphenol content was larger than in the mesquite and huisache leaves. If we considered no priming effect, then 41% of the C added with catclaw leaves, 47% with huisache leaves and 49% with mesquite leaves mineralized within 42 days. The addition of the leaves had little or no effect on N mineralized, and only 6% of organic N of the mesquite leaves was mineralized. It was found that catclaw, huisache and mesquite have a positive effect on the arid and semi-arid ecosystems as they increased soil organic matter and soil N content.}

abstract = {In arid ecosystems, abiotic processes facilitate the physical and chemical degradation of plant litter to the extent that decomposition models that use climatic and litter composition variables as surrogates for microbial activity are not predictive. The purpose of this study was to estimate the potential contribution of photodegradation to the decomposition of plant litters that varies in architecture and chemical composition. Litter of Pinus edulis, Juniperus monosperma and Populus deltoides were exposed to ambient and attenuated sunlight, with and without supplemental water additions, at a riparian forest site along the Middle Rio Grande (New Mexico, USA). Mass loss, elemental composition, and microbial extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) were measured over 639 days. The composition of the fungal communities associated with the decomposing litters was compared by analyses of fungal ITS nrDNA sequences. Litter exposed to ambient sunlight had greater mass loss rates than shaded litter, independent of the water treatment: Populus increased by 100%, Pinus by 86% and Juniperus by 46%. The increases were proportional to exposed litter surface area per g dry mass. EEA potentials, particularly oxidative activities, were low in comparison to those measured in mesic ecosystems. For Populus litter, the principal driver of photoacceleration appeared to be photodegradation of cellulose; for Pinus, it was photodegradation of polyphenols; for Juniperus accelerated mass loss was associated with photodegradation of both polysaccharides and polyphenols. Fungal community composition varied by litter type, but the dominant colonizers were yeasts and dark-septate hyphal taxa; a finding consistent with the low enzymatic oxidation potential. This study shows that photochemical oxidation can supplement enzymatic oxidation and increase decomposition rates. As a result, organic matter decomposition in arid ecosystems is not restricted to periods of high moisture availability as is plant production. This decoupling may partly account for the low soil organic matter content of these ecosystems.}

abstract = {Solar ultraviolet (UV)-A and UV-B radiation were excluded from branches of grey alder (Alnus incana) and white birch (Betula pubescens) trees in a field experiment. Leaf litter collected from these trees was used in microcosm experiments under laboratory conditions. The aim was to evaluate the effects of the different UV treatments on litter chemical quality (phenolic compounds, C, N and lignin) and the subsequent effects of these changes on soil fauna and decomposition processes. We measured the decomposition rate of litter, growth of woodlice (Porcellio scaber), soil microbial respiration and abundance of nematodes and enchytraeid worms. In addition, the chemical quality of woodlice feces was analyzed. The exclusion of both UV-A and UV-B had several effects on litter chemistry. Exclusion of UV-B radiation decreased the C content in litter in both tree species. In alder litter, UV exclusion affected concentration of phenolic groups variably, whereas in birch litter there were no significant differences in phenolic compounds. Moreover, further effects on microbial respiration and chemical quality of woodlice feces were apparent. In both tree species, microbial CO2 evolution was lower in soil with litter produced under exclusion of both UV-A and UV-B radiation when compared to soil with control litter. The N content was higher in the feces of woodlice eating alder litter produced under exclusion of both UV-A and UV-B compared to the control. In addition, there were small changes in the concentration of individual phenolic compounds analyzed from woodlice feces. Our results demonstrate that both UV-A and UV-B alter litter chemistry which in turn affects decomposition processes.}

abstract = {Altered surface ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation resulting from a combination of factors that include changes in stratospheric ozone concentrations, cloud cover, and aerosol conditions may affect litter decomposition and, thus, terrestrial nutrient cycling on a global scale. Although litter decomposition rates vary across biomes, patterns of decomposition suggest that UV-B radiation accelerates litter decay in xeric environments where precipitation is infrequent. However, under more frequent precipitation regimes where litter decay rates are characteristically high, the effect of UV-B radiation on litter decomposition has not been fully elucidated. To evaluate this association between moisture regime and UV-B exposure, a litter decomposition experiment was designed for aspen (Populus tremuloides) leaf litter, where conditions that influence both abiotic (photodegradation) and biotic (microbial) processes could be manipulated quantitatively. We found that experimentally increasing UV-B exposure (0, 7.4, and 11.2 kJ m−2 day−1, respectively) did not consistently increase litter decomposition rates across simulated precipitation frequencies of 4, 12, and 24 days. Instead, a UV-B exposure of 11.2 kJ m−2 day−1 resulted in a 13% decrease in decomposition rates under the 4-day precipitation frequency, but an increase of 80% under the 24-day frequency. Furthermore, the same UV-B dose increased litter decomposition rates under the 24-day precipitation frequency by 78% even in conditions where microbial activity was suppressed. Therefore, under more xeric conditions, greater exposure to UV-B radiation increased decomposition rates, presumably through photodegradation. In contrast, when decomposition was not moisture-limited, greater UV-B exposure slowed decomposition rates, most likely from the resulting inhibition of microbial activity. Ultimately, these experimental results highlight UV-B radiation as a potential driver of decomposition, as well as indicate that both the direction and magnitude of the UV-B effect is dependent on moisture availability, a factor that may change according to future patterns in global precipitation.}

abstract = {Recent studies suggest the long-standing discrepancy between measured and modeled leaf litter decomposition in drylands is, in part, the result of a unique combination of abiotic drivers that include high soil surface temperature and radiant energy levels and soil-litter mixing. Temperature and radiant energy effects on litter decomposition have been widely documented. However, under field conditions in drylands where soil-litter mixing occurs and accelerates decomposition, the mechanisms involved with soil-litter mixing effects are ambiguous. Potential mechanisms may include some combination of enhanced microbial colonization of litter, physical abrasion of litter surfaces, and buffering of litter and its associated decomposers from high temperatures and low moisture conditions. Here, we tested how soil-litter mixing and soil moisture interact to influence rates of litter decomposition in a controlled environment. Foliar litter of two plant species (a grass [Eragrostis lehmanniana] and a shrub [Prosopis velutina]) was incubated for 32 weeks in a factorial combination of soil-litter mixing (none, light, and complete) and soil water content (2, 4, 12% water-filled porosity) treatments. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were quantified one week into the experiment to evaluate initial microbial colonization. A complementary incubation experiment with simulated rainfall pulses tested the buffering effects of soil-litter mixing on decomposition. Under the laboratory conditions of our experiments, the influence of soil-litter mixing was minimal and primarily confined to changes in PLFAs during the initial stages of decomposition in the constant soil moisture experiment and the oscillating soil moisture conditions of the rainfall pulse experiment. Soil-litter mixing effects on CO2 production, total phospholipid concentrations, and bacterial to total PLFA ratios were observed within the first week, but responses were fairly weak and varied with litter type and soil moisture treatment. Across the entire 32-week incubation experiment, soil moisture had a significant positive effect on mass loss, but soil-litter mixing did not. The lack of strong soil-litter mixing effects on decomposition under the moderate and relatively constant environmental conditions of this study is in contrast to results from field studies and suggests the importance of soil-litter mixing may be magnified when the fluctuations and extremes in temperature, radiant energy and moisture regimes common dryland field settings are in play.}

abstract = {Litter decomposition is a central focus of ecosystem science because of its importance to biogeochemical pools and cycling, but predicting dryland decomposition dynamics is problematic. Some studies indicate photodegradation by ultraviolet (UV) radiation can be a significant driver of dryland decomposition, whereas others suggest soil–litter mixing controls decomposition. To test the influence of soil coverage on UV photodegradation of litter, we conducted a controlled environment experiment with shrub (Prosopis velutina) leaf litter experiencing two UV levels and three levels of coverage with dry sterile soil. Under these conditions, decomposition over 224 days was enhanced by UV, but increasing soil coverage strongly and linearly diminished these effects. In a complementary study, we placed P. glandulosa leaf litter in different habitats in the field and quantified litter surface coverage by soil films. After 180 days, nearly half of the surface area of litter placed under shrub canopies was covered by a tightly adhering film composed of soil particles and fungal hyphae; coverage was less in grassy zones between shrubs. We propose a conceptual model for the shifting importance of photodegradation and microbial decomposition over time, and conclude that (1) soil deposition can ameliorate the direct effects of UV photodegradation in drylands and (2) predictions of C losses based solely on UV effects will overestimate the importance of this process in the C cycle. An improved understanding of how development of the soil–litter matrix mediates the shift from abiotic (photodegradation) to biotic (microbial) drivers is necessary to predict how ongoing changes in land cover and climate will influence biogeochemistry in globally extensive drylands.}

abstract = {In arid ecosystems, as much as 75% of solar radiation that penetrates the atmosphere hits the surface of the soil. The combination of high irradiance, high temperature, and low moisture puts constraints on the activity and organization of microbial communities. To separate the direct effects of UV absorbance on litter decomposition from the indirect effects of microbial selection, we placed mixed cohorts of senescent piñon (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) litter into triplicate microcosms assigned to four treatments: UV irradiated (0.6 mW/cm2 UV-A and UV-B for 12 h/day), with and without water additions, and non-irradiated with and without water additions. After 26 weeks, mass loss rates did not differ significantly among treatments with 90% organic matter remaining for piñon litter and 60% for juniper. The distribution and abundance of functional groups as assessed by FTIR spectra did not reveal any differences in relation to treatment, but differences were observed in the quantity and quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) extracted from the samples. The amount of DOC extracted increased by 56% for piñon litter and decreased by 32% for juniper in the UV-only treatment compared to initial values. Litter treated with UV and water had the lowest concentration of DOC with a decrease of 69% for juniper litter and 28% for piñon. The largest concentration of reactive phenols was found in the UV-only treatment with a 309% increase for piñon litter and a 10% reduction for juniper when compared to initial values. The treatments receiving water in the presence or absence of UV showed a similar response for both litter types, a reduction of 20–30% in phenolic concentration. Five extracellular enzyme activities, used, as indicators of microbial activity, were higher in the treatments that received water, but activities did not show an interaction with UV irradiation. The results suggest that UV radiation alone, or in combination with microbial activity, was as effective at decomposing litter as microbial activity alone. Thus, solar radiation can be an important contributor to litter degradation in arid systems.}

We aimed to confirm the involvement of UV radiation under controlled laboratory conditions and quantify the magnitude of any stimulation. Grass and pine foliage samples were oven-dried and continuously exposed to UV radiation at room temperature for up to 60 days. A range of UV flux densities was established using shading to different levels. After UV exposure under air-dry conditions, samples were rewetted and incubated in the dark with microbial inoculums to investigate whether UV exposure had rendered samples more susceptible to subsequent microbial decomposition. However, we found no weight loss associated with different UV flux densities. The same finding held true for grass and pine litter samples. Similarly, microbial decomposition of either grass or pine litter was not enhanced by prior UV exposure. These findings suggest that UV-induced photooxidation of dry materials cannot be responsible for the observed apparent enhancement of weight loss of litter samples under UV exposure in the field.}

abstract = {Leaf litter breakdown is an important process in riparian ecosystems, regulated by the concomitant fluctuations of allochthonous organic matter input (quality and quantity), the environmental conditions, and the decomposer community. Our objective was to assess the effects of temporal variability of litter quantity and quality over the stream's decomposer community. We hypothesized that the litter effects over the decomposer community would be overruled by Cerrado's harsh environmental conditions. Precipitation fluctuations, especially during dry and rain seasons, did modify the litterfall periodicity, but not the average organic matter entering the system or the litterfall triggers. Fifteen riparian species were identified contributing with organic matter into the stream, however, Richeria grandis contributed with 48% of litter biomass, helping explain the nutritional intra-annual balance given by the litter chemistry, that would be determinant for ecosystem stability. Higher aquatic hyphomycetes sporulation rates and invertebrate density during the dry season suggest that the decomposer community required a more stable environment (consistent low current) in order to colonize and exploit leaf litter. Our results point out that physical fragmentation was the predominant driver of litter breakdown for our system, due to high decomposition rates, litter remaining mass correlated negatively with precipitation, and low decomposer abundance and activity. Invertebrate collectors' abundance was negatively correlated with litter remaining mass and showed no temporal variation, suggesting that this functional group may have benefited from the particulate organic matter produced by physical fragmentation. Therefore, annual temporal variations on Brazilian savanna stream systems may drive the functioning of the ecosystem.}

abstract = {Many field experiments have indicated that litter decomposition in semi-arid areas may be partly or fully controlled by photodegradation. We devised a study to test our hypothesis that light exposure makes plant litter more degradable. Dry, senescent, aboveground plant litter from Miscanthus x giganteus was exposed to light including ultraviolet (UV) radiation for various lengths of time from 0 to 289 days. Weight loss was measured after exposure and appeared to be modest and did not increase with time of exposure. The litter of the longest and shortest exposure time as well as controls were then incubated with soil and moisture for 35 days and CO2 and N2O production were measured. The longest exposed litter degraded much faster than any other treatment during incubation with moisture, about twice as fast as the unexposed control. The shortest exposed however, degraded only slightly faster than the unexposed control. This suggests that increasing litter degradability is a more important mechanism for photodegradation than direct light-induced mass loss. N2O production from decomposition of the exposed litter was high in the beginning, suggesting that nitrogen may be released quickly. The mechanism is probably that light exposure leaves the nitrogen in plant litter easily available to microbial utilisation upon wetting. Such a mechanism might play an important role for nutrient cycling in semi-arid areas.}

Our goal is to assess the influence of physical disturbance for ecosystem functioning in coastal sand dunes. We set up an experimental design, including two treatments in four blocks, in a four km-long dune site from South West France. We simulated physical disturbance from marine and wind origin, digging Experimental Notches (EN), in the incipient (West EN treatment) and established foredunes (East EN treatment), respectively and compared the effects of EN to controls along transects including 13 positions from the beach to the transition dune behind ENs. We sampled litter decomposition rate, elevation variation, wind abrasion, sand grain size and vegetation composition. We also used drones to quantify sand deposition sheets during severe winter storms. Litter decomposition rate was the highest where sand accumulated the most, at the ecotone between the established foredune and transition dune and in the East EN treatment. This increase of ecosystem functioning was correlated to wind patterns. However, there was also a strong alongshore variability, with important sand deposition sheets occurring in some blocks depending on dune geomorphology. Vegetation composition was mainly influenced by shoreline distance, but also by the block and EN treatment, with a strong interaction between these three effects. We conclude that physical disturbance increase ecosystem functioning in the stressful conditions of the Atlantic sand dunes, only when sand accumulates, whereas excessive disturbances enhancing sand erosion are not favorable for ecosystem functioning.}

Still, the impacts of irrigation schemes on the functioning of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are poorly understood. Here we assess the effects of irrigation agriculture on breakdown of coarse organic matter in soil and water. We measured breakdown rates of alder and holm oak leaves, and of poplar sticks in terrestrial and aquatic sites following a gradient of increasing irrigation agriculture in a semi-arid Mediterranean basin transformed into irrigation agriculture in 50% of its surface. Spatial patterns of stick breakdown paralleled those of leaf breakdown. In soil, stick breakdown rates were extremely low in non-irrigated sites (0.0001–0.0003 day−1), and increased with the intensity of agriculture (0.0018–0.0044 day−1). In water, stick breakdown rates ranged from 0.0005 to 0.001 day−1, and increased with the area of the basin subject to irrigation agriculture. Results showed that irrigation agriculture affects functioning of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, accelerating decomposition of organic matter, especially in soil. These changes can have important consequences for global carbon budgets.}

We exposed five species of grass and oak litter collected from arid and mesic sites to a factorial design of ultraviolet (UV) radiation (UV pass, UV block), and sterilization under dry conditions in the laboratory. UV pass treatments produced 10 times the amount of CO2 produced in UV block treatments. CO2 production rates were unaffected by litter chemistry or sterilization. We also exposed litter to natural solar radiation outdoors on clear, sunny days close to the summer solstice at midlatitudes and found that UV radiation (280–400 nm) accounted for 55% of photochemically induced CO2 production, while shortwave visible radiation (400–500 nm) accounted for 45% of CO2 production. Rates of photochemically induced CO2 production on a per-unit-mass basis decreased with litter density, indicating that rates depend on litter surface area. We found no evidence for leaching, methane production, or facilitation of microbial decomposition as alternative mechanisms for significant photochemically induced C loss from litter. We conclude that abiotic mineralization to CO2 is the primary mechanism by which C is lost from litter during photodegradation. We estimate that CO2 production via photodegradation could be between 1 and 4 g C m−2 a−1 in arid ecosystems in the southwestern United States. Taken together with low levels of litter production in arid systems, photochemical mineralization to CO2 could account for a significant proportion of annual carbon loss from litter in arid ecosystems.}
